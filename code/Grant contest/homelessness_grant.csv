Current activities include easy exercise, storytelling, arts, and healthy cooking. By providing Wi-Fi and IT equipment we will be able to extend these activities to include digital learning. It should be noted that we have 3 other community bases with Wi-Fi, and we work in close partnership with the Nan McKay Memorial Hall as a welcoming base for learning. These spaces will be used within the project, however in order to reach the target groups outlined above, and a greater number of individuals, this project requires additional support in the form of further Wi-Fi installation, IT equipment and in-kind support from partners.    Delivery of a range of courses (by Glasgow Clyde College) within each community base covering the basic digital skills. By doing so we hope to provide people with the skills to improve their ability to connect with others, save money online, enquire and apply for benefits, carry out research and work together to improve, develop and connect within their local areas. We also envisage that by providing Wi-Fi people may choose to bring their own IT equipment to the bases at a time that suits them (outwith the structured learning/activity times).     We have completed the delivery of 3 courses, 2 in our Sheltered Housing bases in Pollokshields and one within our Berryknowes Base in Cardonald. 7 people attended each programme, all 21 attendees were taught the basics in using tablets, setting up their own email accounts, send and receive emails and searching online. Some participants brought their own laptops or tablets and used their own equipment to build their confidence and existing skills. We will be running another 2 courses over the summer.     Ensuring that people are not simply offered the opportunity of participating in digital learning and using Wi-Fi in their own time (within the bases), but that they are encouraged to connect with existing services and organisations, thus using the project as a foundation for creating pathways to these services and therefore greater outcomes for participants. These other services are currently offered within local libraries, Glasgow Clyde College, the Nan McKay Memorial Hall, Glasgow Homelessness Network and the Govan and Craigton Integration Network. We recognise the importance of ensuring people know what other support exists, which is why this project will be delivered in partnership. Each course incorporated a workshop delivered by Glasgow Libraries where all attendees were informed of the various services the library has to offer. All attendees were given the opportunity to refer themselves to the Glasgow Libraries IT workshops to continue their learning and utilise other services relevant to their needs.     Southside Housing Association (SHA) also purchased and donated IT equipment to other local services. We donated a Smart Board to the Glasgow and Craigton Integration Network (GCIN) to support them in delivering a series of ESOL and IT workshops. We also donated a number of tablets to the Nan Makcay Hall to support them in delivering a similar series of Digital learning workshops. By delivering this project we hope to address some of the barriers people find to going online. Some of which include “it’s too difficult to learn”; “it’s too expensive”; “worrying about privacy/viruses;”; “no connection/computer”’ (CarnegieUK Trust, 2013. Across the Divide –Tackling Digital Exclusion in Glasgow).     Prior to running these courses, Southside Housing Association coordinated a series of consultation meetings within each base and also distributed a feedback questionnaire to all tenants living local to our bases. The consultations and findings of the questionnaire revealed that a significantly high number of tenants were keen to take part in Digital Learning course but felt they were “too old now” or “it’s too hard to learn that stuff”. We also found that many tenants did not have the finances to install Wi-Fi in their homes and purchase equipment of their own. The local bases provide a safe and free space to learn and break down some of these barriers.     At the beginning of each course we asked attendees to complete a Digital inclusion questionnaire, this captured their current skill level and attitudes. We also asked all attendees to complete the questionnaire after the course had completed. We found that all attendees had learned a new skill and most were fairly confident in sending and receiving emails on their own. We observed a change in attitude, particularly amongst older participants who previously believed they were too old to participate. It is good to note that 6 of our older participants now attend the library once a week, use the computer their and also utilise other services the library has to offer.     We have just completed and 8 week Keys to Learn programme, delivered in partnership with Glasgow Homelessness Network (GHN) and City of Glasgow College. The programme works with people at risk of losing their tenancies due to debt, mental health issues, drugs, alcohol etc. The Keys to Learn programme introduces participants to different skills and pathways that could resolve or alleviate such issues. The programme includes cooking on a budget, learning digital skills, budgeting and debt management, managing stress etc. Part of the programmes is also to introduce participants to services offer by SHA and within the local community. For example, participants took part in a session with SHA’s Welfare Rights department and were presented with knowledge and information relevant to their needs. They were also offered individual appointments for additional support needed, in the same way, participants completed a session with the Epic 360 service which offer support to people living in Glasgow with budgeting and debt management. Participants have been encouraged to use their local community bases at meeting spaces for such services and to continue accessing the internet.",GBP,10000,10000,,2015-11-16,,2015-11-16,2016-11-15,,,,,GB-SC-SC036009,Southside Housing Association Ltd,SC036009,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SC-SC003558,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,EH3 9DQ,scvo-digital-charter-fund-call-3,Digital Participation Charter Fund - Call 3,https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,https://scvo.org/digital/participation/charter-fund/projects/data.json,Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,,,,,,2018-07-05T10:56:26+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,

360G-SCVO-a0gb000000QAG4WAAX,Creative Food,"We would like to use fresh surplus food from local suppliers and producers to create free, hot and healthy meals, delivered to those facing disadvantage, inequalities and the impact of the welfare reform. Individuals in temporary accommodation for example have limited access to food storage and preparation facilities and have a limited budget to buy fresh food. Food banks locally provide essential supplies of long life or processed food but not fresh food. Creating a daily menu of freshly prepared nutritious soups, breads, pastas, salads and smoothies that are delivered to those in need will help mitigate the effects of the welfare reform, reduce food poverty, increase health and well being and reduce social isolation. Working in partnership with the local hospitality industry will enable the shared use of catering facilities, food storage and staff to create varied and nutritious menus. It will also provide training and volunteering opportunities for individuals. Working in partnership with other third sector organisations will enable us to pilot a delivery service for the food which will help to break down the barriers of accessibility and the stigma or embarrassment of using a service. It also means we have a much better chance of reaching more vulnerable individuals in homeless accommodation including families in refuges or other temporary bed and breakfast accommodation. This is a completely new approach, innovative in it's ambition to use surplus food that would otherwise got to waste and which is tailor made to suit a remote and rural area and the individual needs of people at grass roots level.

360G-SCVO-a0gb000000QAEZPAA5,LIFE TRANSITION THROUGH VOLUNTEERING,"Izzy's Promise would like to set up a Life Transition Project for ex offenders, people who have been released from prisons and ex addicts or people recovering from addiction. Through this project we will recruit a Sessional worker who will recruit volunteers to help in the delivery of this project. The project will target people who come to our service for support just after they have been released from prisons or those ones trying to overcome a drug and alcohol problems. The people we are targeting to support and help to turn their lives around are those ones who are most affected by the cuts. Due to the economic cuts, most ex offenders and people who have just been released from prison do not access their benefits immediately. This forces some people to sleep rough, homelessness and some are tempted to get involved in petty crimes and street prostitution to make ends. The sessional worker will recruit and train 5 volunteers to help with the project. We plan to reach out and work with 10 vulnerable people who have been adversely affected by the welfare reforms. We will offer them practical support, and also help them to train as volunteers. By supporting such vulnerable people and offering them training on different volunteering roles we will help them to learn new skills that will help them access work. This project is innovative, creative and different as it focused on the most neglected groups in our society. People who have been released from prison, people with addiction problems and people engaged in prostitution are very much stigmatised and lack opportunities that can help them to turn their lives around. Through our project we will be able to support such people, help them overcome their social stigma and hence support them through volunteering.",GBP,5000,6500,,2016-12-02,http://www.izzyspromise.org.uk,2017-01-23,2017-08-23,,,,,GB-SC-SC033706,Izzy's Promise,SC033706,,DD1 1EL,WD,Maryfield,,,,,,,,GB-SC-SC003558,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,EH3 6BB,scvo-ccrf-call-2,Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund/projects/data.json,Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,Scotland,Dundee City,S12000042,Maryfield Ward,S13002549,2018-07-05T10:56:27+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,

MoH uses museum objects as the catalyst for verbatim theatre storytelling to explore and discuss testimonies about homelessness. For this project, Objectified, we want to investigate whether a museum object – and its story - has the power to change motivations and perceptions around the complex subjects of homelessness and health. We will use existing research around homelessness and health to underpin curatorial exploration and sharing with the public. Dr Lasana Harris (UCL), a leading social neuroscientist, will advise on the construction of the stories, drawing on his social cognition research. He will also support MoH to evaluate whether the storytelling changes people’s perceptions.

 

MoH will partner with Groundswell, a GSK award winning homelessness health charity, Professor Kate Hardy (University of Leeds), Dr Tom Gillespie (University of Sheffield), and Dr Harris, to deliver a public engagement programme in Manchester which focuses on health and homelessness, and which engages three audiences: members of the (housed) public, people experiencing homelessness and professionals who work with homeless people in healthcare settings.

(The guide will include tips for example on how to reduce food waste, where to access low cost fresh produce including fruit and vegetables, e.g. details at what times of the day chain stores reduce prices of fresh produce by up to 70%, how to save energy with quick cook and “one pot”, weekly timetable and routes for the Toot 4 Fruit Mobile Fruit and Veg Mobile shop, etc.) • Working with community planning partners to identify the opportunities for improving access to healthy food arising from the Community Empowerment Act. Innovative: Access to non-perishables is provided by food bank but not fresh fruit and veg, and local residents have identified that produce in local shops is overpriced and poor quality. Local growing project have expressed interest in supporting food banks, but mechanisms not yet in place to deal with fresh produce; the creativity in the project would be in producing an earth-to-plate route for getting fresh veg to food bank users.",GBP,4720,6220,,2016-12-02,http://www.mfin.org.uk/,2017-03-01,2017-08-30,,,,,GB-SC-SC035964,Midlothian Financial Inclusion Network,SC035964,,EH22 1AE,WD,Dalkeith,,,,,,,,GB-SC-SC003558,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,EH3 6BB,scvo-ccrf-call-2,Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund/projects/data.json,Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,Scotland,Midlothian,S12000019,Dalkeith Ward,S13003020,2018-07-05T10:56:27+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,
360G-SCVO-a0gb000000QAf6ZAAT,Midlothian Foodbank Healthy Lifestyles Project,"The project will further develop and enhance the foodbank’s current services beyond the provision of emergency food, to the provision of services which help prevent food crises occurring in the first instance. Currently, our foodbank has drop in centres in Gorebridge and Dalkeith, plus a mobile shop called “Toot for Fruit” which travels all over Midlothian, but is particularly targeted at the most socially deprived areas across the county. “Toot for Fruit” (part of NHS Lothian’s Healthy Eating Initiative) provides access to low cost, quality, fresh fruit and vegetables to families and individuals in need. We manage the service on behalf of NHS Lothian. Our plans are to: • Broaden the accessibility of the “Toot for Fruit” service so we are reaching families and individuals struggling to make ends meet and who are therefore at risk of falling into the poverty trap. The goal is that eventually, the service will be available across all communities in Midlothian. • Extend the stock range to include a more comprehensive selection of fresh provisions and therefore making the service more attractive. The range of stock will be extended to include a wider range of fresh produce such as eggs, milk and other dairy products. • Offer workshops on how to cook healthy meals on restricted budgets. We have partnered with Midlothian Hospital Community Gardens who will work with us to develop this service. In our line of work we meet families almost every day who are barely making ends meet, and for whom this project has the potential to be life changing. We are particularly keen to see an impact on lone parent households with dependent children; we know from the Scottish Executive ‘Poverty in Scotland’ report that lone parents are twice as likely to be poor as compared with couples with children.",GBP,5000,5000,,2016-12-02,http://Midlothian.foodbank.org.uk,2017-02-01,2017-07-31,,,,,GB-SC-SCO04673,"Midlothian Foodbank, Gorebridge Parish Church (Church of Scotland)",SCO04673,,EH23 4TT,WD,Midlothian South,,,,,,,,GB-SC-SC003558,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,EH3 6BB,scvo-ccrf-call-2,Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund/projects/data.json,Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,Scotland,Midlothian,S12000019,Midlothian South Ward,S13003023,2018-07-05T10:56:27+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,

Our project is to work specifically on an estate that has many issues such as long term unemployment, debt / rent arrears, anti social behaviour / criminal activity, isolation, mental health issues, fly tipping,vandalism, poverty and loneliness. The Mansfield estate has a 'questionable reputation' that makes homeless people request not to be located on it and current residents apologise for living there. CCAST Highland has recognised and acknowledged a great community spirit that when harnessed, supported and encouraged can make real difference to the lives of people living there. Between Jan and Aug 2017 we will be piloting a variety of programmes based on identified need such as volunteers from the local estate to 'Man' the office offering support and encouragement to the local residents, creating and establishing a new community website and an 'SOS' team. ( Sort Out Saturday ) where residents can book a place in a trailer that will collect unwanted goods and rubbish to go to the tip. There will also be free internet and land line.

360G-SCVO-a0gb000000QAf49AAD,Choose to Move,"We are seeking funding to pilot a socially focused running club which will engage with people who are at risk of becoming completely socially isolated and who are unable or unwilling to access mainstream sport or fitness services. The project will offer an opportunity to a group of Souper Saturday's guests to take part in regular and scheduled physical activity with the aim of helping them to achieve a degree of social structure, leading to improved physical and mental well-being. Through participation in this project people will engage in regular physical exercise, form positive peer relationships, manage their goals and have more structure in their lives all of which will help them to improve their mental health and make it more likely that they will be able to sustain positive lifestyle changes and re-engage with mainstream society. The strength of the proposed project is that it will build on firm, trusting relationships formed over three years with people who make use of Souper Saturday's weekly food and social drop-in activities. These relationships provide us with a unique opportunity to further engage with people who are falling through the net because they are wary of accessing mainstream fitness and sports facilities and/or are experiencing a degree of social isolation making it difficult for traditional fitness, health and well-being services to reach them. In keeping with Souper Saturday's overall philosophy of inclusiveness the people who take part will be encouraged to take part in the decision making process and have ownership of their experience with the group and with the project; we feel that people will be more engaged and will get more from the experience as a social activity of they have had a real and significant part in designing and managing it.",GBP,1200,3200,,2016-12-02,http://soupersaturday.org.uk/,2017-01-17,2017-08-30,,,,,SCVO-001b000003Xx91aAAB-call-2,Souper Saturday,,,EH2 4BJ,WD,City Centre,,,,,,,,GB-SC-SC003558,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,EH3 6BB,scvo-ccrf-call-2,Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund/projects/data.json,Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,Scotland,City of Edinburgh,S12000036,City Centre Ward,S13002929,2018-07-05T10:56:27+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,

We have been offering a variety of services ranging from welfare benefit advice and support to groups that cant communicate in English. We have also been supporting asylum seekers in the transition process. As you may already be aware once they have been given leave to remain in UK they only have 28 days in which to access main stream services including securing appropriate housing, accessing main stream benefits and other services. This period is particularly vulnerable time for this groups as they make the transition from complete dependency upon UKBA, to being responsible for negotiating the complex housing health and benefit system while also contacting utility companies. There is loss of skill and confidence through the immigration journey and the fact that they do not speak English places a great barrier to them. Our organisation aims to continue supporting them in this transition. We offer a person centred approach and aim to expand to other food banks in Glasgow city .

360G-ocf-a061600000lwFHz,Soundworks,"We recently fostered a link with a local recording studio (Soundworks in Blackbird Leys) that has offered opportunities to two people we work with to visit the studio for four weeks each to experience difference areas of the recording process. This had a profound effect on the people involved, and following this, we had lots of other people express interest and excitement. Unfortunately, the recording studio cannot sustain an ongoing project for free and we would like to create an ongoing programme that will enable more people to benefit from this unique opportunity. We are applying to the Midcounties Co-operative Community fund for funding to cover costs to enable an individual to have four weekly sessions of two hours each int he recording studio. In their studio time, they can choose what area they would like to learn about - be it production, mixing ore recording etc. We also have music tutors who would be willing to offer music lessons for very reduced prices. People could therefore also choose to have an hour music tuition int he studio space, with instruments provided, which they could then use towards their wider work in the studio. This programme would run for one year, enabling twelve people to participate with a structure of two sessions with an engineer and two with practice time and an hour of music lessons (if wanted or simply four with an engineer. This project has the scope to positively affect the people we work with ina variety of ways. It offers them the chance to be part of a creative process, and to access the arts in a less traditional more exciting way. It is also a very flexible opportunity, which allows them to choose exactly what areas they want to learn about, from writing songs to dj-ing to learning about production technology. It can be a way for people to start thinking about education as more expansive than just classrooms (which does not suit so many people). It also offers people the chance to take on responsibility for an activity, in which they must focus on timekeeping and behaviour. Fundamentally, this is something that will take place outside of the homeless pathway. Travelling somewhere that is not part of 'service rout', and in which they meet members of the wider community, is often an underestimated experience. We find that participating in activities with the general public is something that the people we work with find valuable, and is instrumental in changing their perceptions of themselves as 'outsiders' We hope that, with time, to see this project lead to the formation of a band that will also encourage people to see the therapeutic benefits of music and working as a team.",GBP,1920,1920,1920,2016-11-14T00:00:00+00:00,,2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00,2017-12-01T00:00:00+00:00,,,,,360G-ocf-org:1035524,Mayday Trust,1035524,2911222,OX1 1QT,,,,,,,,,,GB-CHC-1151621,Oxfordshire Community Foundation,,,,,Blackbird Leys,GB,Oxford 008B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,http://oxfordshire.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/OCF-Grants_FY16-17-final.xlsx,Oxfordshire Community Foundation,South Central,Oxford District,E07000178,Carfax Ward,E05006547,2018-07-05T10:56:07+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,

360G-OCF-A468675,Specialist parenting courses for ex-offenders - improving family life,"This grant will be spent on delivering three specialist Nurturing Programme Family Links parenting courses specifically aimed at ex-offenders both in custody and also for those in the community. Each parenting course will run for a total of 12 weeks including a pre-delivery and evaluation session. The parenting course is a Nurturing Programme designed to help parents who are ex-offenders to manage their feelings and behaviour while becoming more positive and nurturing in their relationships with their children and with each other. Learning modules will include giving praise, discipline, family rules, personal power and self-esteem, communicating feelings and stages of child development. For Aspire's clients, who come from very deprived backgrounds and may not have had positive experiences of parenting growing up, these courses are invaluable to break unhealthy cycles of behaviour. We expect that 24 ex-offenders will attend these courses (8 learners per course) and once completed, they will benefit from greater emotional literacy in parenting skills designed to greatly strengthen family life and protect children from future antisocial behaviour. The indirect beneficiaries of this project will be in excess of 96 people.",GBP,4926,3284,,2018-02-27T00:00:00+00:00,http://www.aspireoxford.co.uk,2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00,2019-01-01T00:00:00+00:00,10,,,,GB-COH-04270053,Aspire,1117726,04270053,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CHC-1151621,Oxfordshire Community Foundation,,Family life reducing crime Feb 18,Delivering Impact,,Oxford 008B,GB,E01028522,LSOA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://3p50ut4bws5s2uzhmycc4t21-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OCF-Grants_FY17-18_21mar.xlsx,Oxfordshire Community Foundation,,,,,,2018-07-05T10:56:05+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,

360G-OCF-A449966,Social Enterprise Didcot,"SOFEA, launched in 2014, provides education and support to young people who are disadvantaged or vulnerable, with the aim of enabling them to progress successfully to further study or work. Young people follow a programme with three strands: - Qualifications including GCSE Maths and English, Team leadership, Employability, Forklift certification - Work experience in our food redistribution social enterprise redistributing 500 tonnes of good quality food to over 100 other charities (with our partners FareShare) - A sophisticated behavioural change programme which enables young people to develop strategies for successful behaviours We work with over 100 young people each year, with 85% successfully progressing. In addition we encourage disadvantaged adults to volunteer to improve their skills. The food we redistribute feeds 10000 people across the Thames Valley who otherwise wouldn’t have had access to it including the homeless, those with learning disabilities, children and the elderly. The Trustees have determined the criteria for any new enterprise: - Completely inclusive - Authentic work environments, earning income - Social output beyond the education programme - Individual programmes for young people - Including all three elements of the SOFEA model We acknowledge that there are a wide range of potential partner organisations with experience and skills who can add value and we have met with the CEO of ATG to explore a bicycle enterprise, Yellow Submarine to discuss a catering outlet, Train, the RAW workshop and Aspire Oxford. We have begun to investigate the activities that the community needs before identifying potential projects. We will conduct a feasibility study for launching a second enterprise (using the SOFEA model) and then a third enterprise, with the intention of continuing to grow and provide employment for some of the project participants. Step Change will take us from the feasibility to launch. We will use the money to employ a full time operations manager to manage the current SOFEA operation, this will enable the CEO of SOFEA to work three full days per week on the development plan of the new social enterprises. The CEO will: - Produce a feasibility study for the new enterprises within one month of the project start - Develop relationships with as many local partners as possible including the Town and District Councils, Didcot First, the Rotary Club, local businesses and other third sector organisations - Ensure the enterprises meet the local demand and reflect local skills issues, in line with OXLEP’s Skills Strategy - Set out the strategic direction - Develop a fully costed Business Plan - Complete the operational planning including sourcing location and equipment - Conduct fundraising with the aim of raising the total initial startup costs - Preimplementation planning, including recruiting young people to the programme and recruiting staff - Launch of the new enterprise The Operations Manager will: - Continue to grow the current SOFEA social enterprise - Ensure that SOFEA systems and processes can be replicated in new social enterprise settings - To ensure economies of scale across enterprises are maximised For each social enterprise we will: - Work with 50 vulnerable or disadvantaged young people, on bespoke individual programmes leading to employment or further study, with a success rate of at least 85% - Work with 12 volunteers, at least half of whom will be disadvantaged or vulnerable - Generate enough income to cover two thirds of the running costs in year 2 - Directly employ young people coming through our own leadership programmes, with a likely target of two per enterprise - Add social value to the local community, through the provision of goods and services, beyond the education programme - Work directly with a range of local employers to provide routes into high quality employment - Involve as many parts of the local community as possible - Create a model which is regarded as an asset to the town of Didcot as it grows and becomes a Garden Town",GBP,40000,45500,,2017-09-18T00:00:00+00:00,http://www.sofea.uk.com,,,,,,,GB-CHC-5511783,South Oxfordshire Food and Education Alliance,5511783,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CHC-1151621,Oxfordshire Community Foundation,,September 2017,Step Change Fund,,South Oxfordshire 009A,GB,E01028625,LSOA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://3p50ut4bws5s2uzhmycc4t21-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OCF-Grants_FY17-18_21mar.xlsx,Oxfordshire Community Foundation,,,,,,2018-07-05T10:56:05+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/,

360G-Wellcome-107318_Z_15_Z,Undercurrent's new theatre production about the scientist and geneticist George Price (1922  1975) in partnership with Camden People s Theatre.,"'Meet George' sees acclaimed Undercurrent create an arresting new production based on the life of George Price (1922-1975). Presented in co-production with Camden People's Theatre in Autumn 2015, staged within yards from where Price lived, worked and died. Price taught himself the basics of evolutionary genetics and formulated an equation widely acknowledged as the mathematical explanation for the evolution of altruism - something science had been trying to do since Darwin. The Price Equation w as so extraordinary, University College London gave Price an honorary position within ninety minutes of him walking in off the street. The magnitude of his discovery shook Price's atheism to the core. He believed it must be a gift from God. Three years later, Price was discovered in a squat having slit his throat. Seven men attended his funeral - five homeless and two of our greatest evolutionary biologists. This ambitious new work, directed by Laura Farnworth, with Dr. Gardner (St.Andrews Uni versity); Professor Graffen (Oxford University); Professor Pomiankowski (UCL) and Dr.Valli (Institute of Psychiatry), shares the man, his work and extraordinary life. Watching Price wrestle with and ultimately falling victim to his theory, will have profound implications for the way we understand ourselves. Undercurrent weighs up the question: was Price mentally ill, or consumed by a spiritual desire to disprove his own theory: that man is only kind to his own kin? Price's radical acts of altrui sm challenge us to examine our own acts of kindness in a time of austerity and self interest.",GBP,,30000,,2015-01-20T00:00:00+00:00,,2015-05-01T00:00:00+00:00,2016-06-30T00:00:00+00:00,,,,,360G-Wellcome-ORG:Undercurrent-Theatre,Undercurrent Theatre,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,,,Small Arts Award,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx,Wellcome Trust,,,,,,2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,
360G-Wellcome-101327_Z_13_Z,The Mouse.,"23-minute drama. THE MOUSE is a tender love story concealed within a fierce urban thriller. It dramatises the interface of bipolar disorder, psychiatry and deprivation in the life of a vulnerable teenager. The project is a collaboration between filmmaker Theo Baines, adolescent psychiatrist Dr Simon Lewis (clinical lead, Simmons House NHS residential unit) and cinema story-editor Walter Donohue (Paris Texas, 28 Days Later). The film explores the impact of social and economic deprivatio n in adolescence on young people's first experiences of mental illness and psychiatry, and on their subsequent risk of isolation, unemployment and homelessness in early adulthood. A psychotic young homeless man is sectioned by police in east London and taken to A&E. In a psychiatric assessment, Jacob tells his story: Two weeks earlier he travels to London, leaving his medication to begin again without it. He finds work in a kitchen and meets 15-year-old Ayla. They fascinate each other.   Ayla loves the mice she sees under the tracks at tube stations. Jacob devotes himself to getting her one by any means possible - in an increasingly imaginative series of schemes. Unaware of his endeavours but alarmed by his unsettled personality, Ayla ends their short relationship. Heart-broken, unemployed and homeless, Jacobs rapid-cycling symptoms of bipolar disorder and anxiety become increasingly serious, and his quest to catch a mouse ever-more urgent. The story ends in a suspenseful enco unter at Aylas family home. To be offered free online and to Key-Stage 4 PSHE teachers. Promotional campaign will target audience of 15-25-year-olds.",GBP,,29990,,2013-04-10T00:00:00+00:00,,2014-07-01T00:00:00+00:00,2015-11-30T00:00:00+00:00,,,,,360G-Wellcome-ORG:The-Whittington-Charity,The Whittington Charity,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CHC-210183,The Wellcome Trust,,,Small Arts Award,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/wellcome-grants-awarded-2005-2017_0.xlsx,Wellcome Trust,,,,,,2018-07-05T10:59:03+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,

The process will culminate in a unique piece of theatre that reflects the young peoples own experiences, findings and connections and provokes its a udience to debate the question: Violence - Choice or Response? Performances will lead to public debates, panelled by our participants and scientific collaborators, using Cardboard Citizens' expertise in Forum Theatre to engage audiences into active discussion. Exchange is pivotal to the Heritage of Violence: exchange between two groups of young people, sharing findings, ideas and creative feedback; exchange between scientists, young people and arts organisations informing the perspectives and  practices of each; exchange between project participants, scientists and the wider public, debating the extent to which young people are able to control destructive behaviours, the potential for positive change, and what an appropriate response from society might be.

We will tackle social isolation by extending provision of community meals, moving around local venues to encourage wider uptake. Participants will be encouraged to take a stake in running the programme, to ensure it offers what is needed/wanted locally, and to give it the best chance of enduring beyond the grant period. Peer training will be developed, improving social and work skills, improving self esteem/confidence. The current welfare cuts have left many local people struggling to feed themselves and their families on totally inadequate income. What we propose is a creative alternative support system, where people develop skills (including from each other) to get the most out of what is available locally, to help each other out and to gain satisfaction from focusing on their health and on contributing to local environmental benefit, rather than feeling overwhelmed by their powerlessness and having to rely on handouts.",GBP,4900,6400,,2016-12-02,http://www.the-ridge.org.uk,2017-01-17,2017-08-25,,,,,GB-SC-SC047116,The Ridge SCIO,SC047116,,EH42 1TF,WD,Dunbar and East Linton,,,,,,,,GB-SC-SC003558,Scottish Council For Voluntary Organisations,EH3 6BB,scvo-ccrf-call-2,Community Capacity & Resilience Fund - Call 2,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Yes,,https://scvo.org/running-your-organisation/funding/community-capacity-resilience-fund/projects/data.json,Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations,Scotland,East Lothian,S12000010,Dunbar and East Linton Ward,S13002913,2018-07-05T10:56:27+00:00,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/,
