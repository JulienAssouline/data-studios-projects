15,CORDÉ,... I'm sorry m'lady... I'm... not sure I... ,True,Attack of the Clones
17,AMIDALA,No!... No!... No!...,True,Attack of the Clones
19,AMIDALA,I should not have come back.,True,Attack of the Clones
20,CAPTAIN TYPHO,M'Lady you are still in danger.,True,Attack of the Clones
22,CAPTAIN TYPHO,This vote is very important. You did your duty and Cordé did hers. Now come.  M'Lady please!,True,Attack of the Clones
26,MAS AMEDDA,Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent and that is what we will vote on at this time.,True,Attack of the Clones
28,PALPATINE,...My esteemed colleagues excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... Has been assassinated!,True,Attack of the Clones
30,PALPATINE, This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice not only in this honourable assembly but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend.,True,Attack of the Clones
32,SENATOR ASK AAK,How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now and they need an army to do it.,True,Attack of the Clones
34,AMBASSADOR DARSANA,Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe under their protection.,True,Attack of the Clones
36,ORN FREE TAA,The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war.,True,Attack of the Clones
37,PALPATINE,Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here... not war.,True,Attack of the Clones

41,PALPATINE,It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo Padmé Amidala.,True,Attack of the Clones
42,PADME,Less than an hour ago an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but more importantly I believe this security measure before you was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage...,True,Attack of the Clones
44,PADME,  I warn you if you vote to create this army war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war  first-hand; I do not wish to do it again.,True,Attack of the Clones
46,PADME,Wake up Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.,True,Attack of the Clones
48,ORN FREE TAA,My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law.,True,Attack of the Clones
50,PALPATINE,Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then the Senate stands adjourned.,True,Attack of the Clones
53,PALPATINE,I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.,True,Attack of the Clones
54,MACE WINDU ,If they do break away -,True,Attack of the Clones
55,PALPATINE,No! I will not let that happen!,True,Attack of the Clones
56,MACE WINDU ,But if they do you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace not soldiers.,True,Attack of the Clones
57,PALPATINE,Master Yoda do you think it will really come to war?,True,Attack of the Clones

70,PADME,I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.,True,Attack of the Clones
72,MACE WINDU ,You know M'Lady Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone it is not in his character.,True,Attack of the Clones
73,KI-ADI-MUNDI,He is a political idealist not a murderer.,True,Attack of the Clones
74,YODA,In dark times nothing is what it appears to be but the fact remains Senator in grave danger you are.,True,Attack of the Clones
76,PALPATINE,Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?,True,Attack of the Clones

82,PALPATINE,"...""situation is that serious."" No but I do Senator.",True,Attack of the Clones
83,PADME,Chancellor please! I don't want any more guards!,True,Attack of the Clones
84,PALPATINE,I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi...,True,Attack of the Clones
86,MACE WINDU ,That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.,True,Attack of the Clones
87,PALPATINE,You must remember him M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.,True,Attack of the Clones
88,PADME,This is not necessary Chancellor.,True,Attack of the Clones
89,PALPATINE,Do it for me M'Lady please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.,True,Attack of the Clones
91,MACE WINDU ,I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones
93,YODA,Too little about yourself you worry Senator and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger Padmé. Accept our help.,True,Attack of the Clones

129,ANAKIN,Why?,True,Attack of the Clones
130,OBI-WAN,What??!!,True,Attack of the Clones
131,ANAKIN,Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.,True,Attack of the Clones
132,OBI-WAN,We will do as the Council has instructed and you will learn your place young one.,True,Attack of the Clones

145,YODA,Masking the future is this disturbance in the Force.,True,Attack of the Clones
146,MACE WINDU ,The propecy is coming true the Dark Side is growing.,True,Attack of the Clones

166,OBI-WAN,You're using her as bait??,True,Attack of the Clones
167,ANAKIN,It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.,True,Attack of the Clones

179,ANAKIN,I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.,True,Attack of the Clones
180,OBI-WAN,Mind your thoughts Anakin they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.,True,Attack of the Clones
181,ANAKIN,She's not like the others in the Senate Master.,True,Attack of the Clones
182,OBI-WAN,It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.,True,Attack of the Clones
183,ANAKIN,Not another lecture Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.,True,Attack of the Clones

387,PADME, Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.,True,Attack of the Clones
389,OBI-WAN,Anakin you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.,True,Attack of the Clones
390,ANAKIN,Yes Master.,True,Attack of the Clones
391,OBI-WAN, I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.,True,Attack of the Clones
392,PADME,I will be most grateful for your speed Master Jedi.,True,Attack of the Clones
393,ANAKIN,Time to go.,True,Attack of the Clones
394,PADME,I know. ,True,Attack of the Clones
396,OBI-WAN,May the Force be with you.,True,Attack of the Clones
397,ANAKIN,May the Force be with you Master.,True,Attack of the Clones
399,PADME,Suddenly I'm afraid...,True,Attack of the Clones
400,ANAKIN,I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.,True,Attack of the Clones
401,PADME,There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.,True,Attack of the Clones
404,OBI-WAN,I hope he doesn't try anything foolish.,True,Attack of the Clones
405,CAPTAIN TYPHO,I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.,True,Attack of the Clones
409,PK-4,Place the subject for analysis on the sensot tray please.,True,Attack of the Clones
411,OBI-WAN,It's a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it.,True,Attack of the Clones
412,PK-4,One moment please.,True,Attack of the Clones
414,PK-4, As you can see on your screen subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. Markings cannot be identified. Probablt self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society.,True,Attack of the Clones
415,OBI-WAN,Excuse me? Could you try again please?,True,Attack of the Clones
416,PK-4,Master Jedi our records are very thorough. they cover eight percent of the galaxy. If I can't tell you where it came from nobody can.,True,Attack of the Clones
418,OBI-WAN,Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out but I think I know someone who might.,True,Attack of the Clones
421,SERVER,Keep moving! Keep moving!,True,Attack of the Clones
423,FOOD SERVER, Hey! No Droids!,True,Attack of the Clones
425,ANAKIN,No no Mom no...,True,Attack of the Clones
427,ANAKIN, What?,True,Attack of the Clones
428,PADME,You seemed to be having a nightmare.,True,Attack of the Clones
430,PADME, Are you hungry?,True,Attack of the Clones
431,ANAKIN,Thank you.,True,Attack of the Clones
432,PADME,We went into lightspeed a while ago.,True,Attack of the Clones
434,ANAKIN,I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...,True,Attack of the Clones
436,PADME,You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.,True,Attack of the Clones
437,ANAKIN,I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.,True,Attack of the Clones
438,PADME,It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...,True,Attack of the Clones
439,ANAKIN,Or be with the people I love.,True,Attack of the Clones
440,PADME,Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.,True,Attack of the Clones
441,ANAKIN,Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion which I would define as unconditional love is central to a Jedi's life so you might say we're encouraged to love.,True,Attack of the Clones
442,PADME,You have changed so much,True,Attack of the Clones
443,ANAKIN,You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.,True,Attack of the Clones
444,PADME,It hasn't...,True,Attack of the Clones
445,ANAKIN,I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force those hills are what I see.,True,Attack of the Clones
447,ANAKIN, I love Naboo.,True,Attack of the Clones
449,PADME, Were you dreaming about you mother earlier weren't you?,True,Attack of the Clones
450,ANAKIN,Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.,True,Attack of the Clones
455,HERMIONE,Can I help ya?,True,Attack of the Clones
456,OBI-WAN,I'm looking for Dexter.,True,Attack of the Clones
458,HERMIONE BAGWA,Waddya want him for?,True,Attack of the Clones
459,OBI-WAN,He's not in trouble. It's personal.,True,Attack of the Clones
461,HERMIONE BAGWA,Someone to see ya honey  A Jedi by the looks of him.,True,Attack of the Clones
463,DEXTER JETTSTER,Obi-Wan!,True,Attack of the Clones
464,OBI-WAN,Hey Dex.,True,Attack of the Clones
465,DEXTER JETTSTER,Take a seat! Be right with ya!,True,Attack of the Clones
467,HERMIONE BAGWA,You want a cup of ardees?,True,Attack of the Clones
468,OBI-WAN,Thank you.,True,Attack of the Clones
470,DEXTER JETTSTER,Hey ol' buddy!,True,Attack of the Clones
471,OBI-WAN,Hey Dex.,True,Attack of the Clones
473,DEXTER JETTSTER,So my friend. What can I do for ya?,True,Attack of the Clones
474,OBI-WAN,You can tell me what this is.,True,Attack of the Clones
476,DEXTER JETTSTER,Well whattaya know...,True,Attack of the Clones
478,DEXTER JETTSTER, I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!,True,Attack of the Clones
479,OBI-WAN,Do you know where it came from?,True,Attack of the Clones
481,DEXTER JETTSTER,This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.,True,Attack of the Clones
482,OBI-WAN,Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.,True,Attack of the Clones
483,DEXTER JETTSTER,It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.,True,Attack of the Clones
484,OBI-WAN,Well Dex if droids could think we wouldn't be here would we?  Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?,True,Attack of the Clones
485,DEXTER JETTSTER,No it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze toward the south. It should be easy to find even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones too.,True,Attack of the Clones
487,OBI-WAN,Cloners? Are they friendly?,True,Attack of the Clones
488,DEXTER JETTSTER,It depends.,True,Attack of the Clones
489,OBI-WAN,On what Dex?,True,Attack of the Clones
491,DEXTER JETTSTER,On how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is...,True,Attack of the Clones
495,ANAKIN,If I grew up here I don't think I'd ever leave.,True,Attack of the Clones
496,PADME, I doubt that.,True,Attack of the Clones
497,ANAKIN,No really. When I started my training I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was the more I thought about my Mom the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...,True,Attack of the Clones
498,PADME,...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.,True,Attack of the Clones
499,ANAKIN,Well tell me did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?,True,Attack of the Clones
500,PADME," No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the ""Refugee Relief Movement."" I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight I joined the ""Apprentice Legislators"" then later on became a Senatorial advisor with such a passion that before I knew it I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected but now that I think back on it I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.",True,Attack of the Clones
501,ANAKIN,The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.,True,Attack of the Clones
502,PADME,Popular rule is not democracy Annie. It gives the people what they want not what they need. And truthfully I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator I couldn't refuse her.,True,Attack of the Clones
503,ANAKIN,I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.,True,Attack of the Clones
504,PADME,I think so too.,True,Attack of the Clones
507,QUEEN JAMILLIA,We've been worried about you.  I'm so glad you're safe Padmé.,True,Attack of the Clones
508,PADME,Thank you Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.,True,Attack of the Clones
509,SIO BIBBLE,Given the circumstances Senator you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made.,True,Attack of the Clones
510,QUEEN JAMILLIA,How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?,True,Attack of the Clones
511,PADME,About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.,True,Attack of the Clones
512,SIO BIBBLE,It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!,True,Attack of the Clones
513,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Do you see any way through negotiations to bring the separatists back into the Republic?,True,Attack of the Clones
514,PADME,Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army but if they are provoked they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.,True,Attack of the Clones
515,QUEEN JAMILLIA,The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?,True,Attack of the Clones
516,PADME,I'm afraid that despite the Chancellor's best efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.,True,Attack of the Clones
517,SIO BIBBLE,It's outrageous! After all of those hearings and the four trials in the Supreme Court Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?,True,Attack of the Clones
518,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Remember Counsellor the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction.,True,Attack of the Clones
519,PADME,There are rumours Your Highness that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.,True,Attack of the Clones
520,ANAKIN,The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy we were told.,True,Attack of the Clones
521,QUEEN JAMILLIA,We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.,True,Attack of the Clones
522,PADME,Let's pray that day never comes.,True,Attack of the Clones
523,QUEEN JAMILLIA,In the meantime we must consider your own safety.,True,Attack of the Clones
525,SIO BIBBLE, What is your suggestion Master Jedi?,True,Attack of the Clones
526,PADME,Anakin's not a Jedi yet Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...,True,Attack of the Clones
527,ANAKIN, Hey hold on a minute!,True,Attack of the Clones
528,PADME,Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.,True,Attack of the Clones
529,ANAKIN,Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones
531,PADME,Annie my life is at risk and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.,True,Attack of the Clones
532,ANAKIN, Sorry M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones
533,SIO BIBBLE, She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.,True,Attack of the Clones
534,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Perfect. It's settled then.,True,Attack of the Clones
536,QUEEN JAMILLIA, Padmé I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you.,True,Attack of the Clones
542,JOCASTA NU,Did you call for assistance?,True,Attack of the Clones
543,OBI-WAN, Yes... yes I did...,True,Attack of the Clones
544,JOCASTA NU,He has a powerful face doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.,True,Attack of the Clones
545,OBI-WAN,I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.,True,Attack of the Clones
546,JOCASTA NU, The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.,True,Attack of the Clones
547,OBI-WAN,What happened?,True,Attack of the Clones
548,JOCASTA NU,Well one might say he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master Qui-Gon Jinn.,True,Attack of the Clones
549,OBI-WAN, Really?,True,Attack of the Clones
550,JOCASTA NU,Oh yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists...,True,Attack of the Clones
552,JOCASTA NU,(continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber in the old style of fencing he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.,True,Attack of the Clones
553,OBI-WAN,Interesting... I'm still not sure I understand.,True,Attack of the Clones
554,JOCASTA NU,Well I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem Master Kenobi?,True,Attack of the Clones
555,OBI-WAN,Yes I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.,True,Attack of the Clones
556,JOCASTA NU,Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with... Let me see...,True,Attack of the Clones
558,JOCASTA NU, Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?,True,Attack of the Clones
559,OBI-WAN, According to my information it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze.,True,Attack of the Clones
561,JOCASTA NU,No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader.,True,Attack of the Clones
562,OBI-WAN,All three actually.,True,Attack of the Clones
563,JOCASTA NU,Are you sure it exists?,True,Attack of the Clones
564,OBI-WAN,Absolutely.,True,Attack of the Clones
565,JOCASTA NU,Let me do a gravitational scan.,True,Attack of the Clones
567,JOCASTA NU,There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed.,True,Attack of the Clones
568,OBI-WAN,Wouldn't that be on record?,True,Attack of the Clones
569,JOCASTA NU,It ought to be. Unless it was very recent.  I hate to say it but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.,True,Attack of the Clones
570,OBI-WAN,That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.,True,Attack of the Clones
571,JOCASTA NU,The archives are comprehensive and totally secure my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records it does not exist!,True,Attack of the Clones
574,PADME,There's my house!,True,Attack of the Clones
576,PADME, What? Don't say you're shy!,True,Attack of the Clones
577,ANAKIN, No but I...,True,Attack of the Clones
579,RYOO & POOJA,Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!,True,Attack of the Clones

602,SOLA,Well this is exciting! Do you know Anakin you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?,True,Attack of the Clones
603,PADME, Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.,True,Attack of the Clones
604,JOVAL,A bodyguard?! Oh Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!,True,Attack of the Clones
605,PADME,It's not Mom I promise.  Anyway Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?,True,Attack of the Clones
607,PADME, He grew up.,True,Attack of the Clones
608,JOBAL,Honey when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!,True,Attack of the Clones
609,PADME,Mom I'm not in any danger.,True,Attack of the Clones
610,RUWEE, Is she?,True,Attack of the Clones
611,ANAKIN,...Yes... I'm afraid she is.,True,Attack of the Clones
612,PADME, But not much.,True,Attack of the Clones
614,RUWEE,Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say I'm happy here.,True,Attack of the Clones
615,ANAKIN,Padme tells me you teach at the university?,True,Attack of the Clones
616,RUWEE, Yes and before that I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement when I was very young.,True,Attack of the Clones
618,SOLA,Why haven't you told us about him?,True,Attack of the Clones
619,PADME,What's there to talk about?  He's just a boy.,True,Attack of the Clones
620,SOLA,A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?,True,Attack of the Clones
621,PADME,Sola - stop it!,True,Attack of the Clones
622,SOLA,It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying little baby sister that you haven't noticed?,True,Attack of the Clones
623,PADME,I'm not your baby sister Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional.  Mom would you tell her to stop it?,True,Attack of the Clones
624,SOLA, Well maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.,True,Attack of the Clones
625,PADME,Cut it out.,True,Attack of the Clones
626,JOBAL,Sola's just concerned... we all are.,True,Attack of the Clones
627,PADME,Oh Mom you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.,True,Attack of the Clones
628,JOBAL,You've done your service Padmé. It's time you had a life of your own. You're missing so much!,True,Attack of the Clones
630,RUWEE,Now tell me son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?,True,Attack of the Clones
631,ANAKIN,There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation won't last long.,True,Attack of the Clones
632,RUWEE,I don't want anything to happen to her.,True,Attack of the Clones
633,ANAKIN,I don't either.,True,Attack of the Clones
635,PADME,Don't worry this won't take long.,True,Attack of the Clones
636,ANAKIN,I just want to get there before dark.,True,Attack of the Clones
638,ANAKIN, You still live at home.,True,Attack of the Clones
639,PADME,I move around so much I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.,True,Attack of the Clones
640,ANAKIN,I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.,True,Attack of the Clones
642,ANAKIN, Is this you?,True,Attack of the Clones
644,PADME,That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula which means sweethear. He was so full of  life. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet.,True,Attack of the Clones
646,PADME, My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?,True,Attack of the Clones
650,YODA,Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you it will.  Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.,True,Attack of the Clones

653,CHILDREN,Welcome Master Obi-Wan!,True,Attack of the Clones
654,OBI-WAN,I am sorry to disturb you Master.,True,Attack of the Clones
655,YODA,What help to you can I be?,True,Attack of the Clones
656,OBI-WAN,Im looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesnt show up on the archive maps.,True,Attack of the Clones
657,YODA,An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it we will try...,True,Attack of the Clones
659,OBI-WAN,This is where it ought to be... but it isnt. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isnt.,True,Attack of the Clones
660,YODA,Most interesting. Gravitys silhouette remains but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?,True,Attack of the Clones
662,JEDI CHILD JACK,Because someone erased it from the archive memory.,True,Attack of the Clones
663,CHILDREN,Thats right! Yes! Thats what happened! Someone erased it!,True,Attack of the Clones
664,JEDI CHILD MAY,If the planet blew up the gravity would go away.,True,Attack of the Clones
666,YODA,Truly wonderful the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go and find your planet you will.,True,Attack of the Clones
667,OBI-WAN,But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? Thats impossible isnt it?,True,Attack of the Clones
668,YODA, Much harder to answer that question is.,True,Attack of the Clones
672,PADME,When I was in Level Three we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.,True,Attack of the Clones
673,ANAKIN,I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.,True,Attack of the Clones
675,PADME,...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.,True,Attack of the Clones
676,ANAKIN,I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everythings soft... and smooth...,True,Attack of the Clones
678,PADME,There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.,True,Attack of the Clones
679,ANAKIN, Everything here is magical.,True,Attack of the Clones
680,PADME,You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasnt.,True,Attack of the Clones
681,ANAKIN,Sometimes when you believe something to be real it becomes real. Real enough anyway...,True,Attack of the Clones
683,PADME,I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass you would lose yourself.,True,Attack of the Clones
684,ANAKIN,I think it's true...,True,Attack of the Clones
686,PADME,I shouldn't have done that.,True,Attack of the Clones
687,ANAKIN,I'm sorry. When I'm around you my mind is no longer my own.,True,Attack of the Clones
688,PADME,It's the situation... the stress...,True,Attack of the Clones
690,ANAKIN,...the view.,True,Attack of the Clones
692,MACE WINDU ,Be wary this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.,True,Attack of the Clones
693,OBI-WAN,I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.,True,Attack of the Clones
694,YODA,The Council is confident in this decision Obi-Wan.,True,Attack of the Clones
695,MACE WINDU,He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.,True,Attack of the Clones

704,OBI-WAN,Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?,True,Attack of the Clones

727,ANAKIN,From the moment I met you all those years ago a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again I'm in agony. The closer I get to you the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...,True,Attack of the Clones

732,PADME,You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.,True,Attack of the Clones
733,ANAKIN,Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.,True,Attack of the Clones
734,PADME,Annie it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future for me.,True,Attack of the Clones
735,ANAKIN,I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.,True,Attack of the Clones
736,PADME,I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.,True,Attack of the Clones
738,ANAKIN,It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.,True,Attack of the Clones
739,PADME,Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you Anakin? Could you live like that?,True,Attack of the Clones

780,PADME,How would you have it work?,True,Attack of the Clones
781,ANAKIN,We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems agree what's in the best interests of all the people and then do it.,True,Attack of the Clones
782,PADME,That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact they hardly ever do.,True,Attack of the Clones

804,LAMA SU, Magnificent aren't they?,True,Attack of the Clones
807,LAMA SU,We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient taking any order without question.,True,Attack of the Clones
808,OBI-WAN,Who was the original host?,True,Attack of the Clones
809,LAMA SU,A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself.,True,Attack of the Clones
810,OBI-WAN,Where is this bounty hunter now?,True,Attack of the Clones
811,LAMA SU,Oh we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones the genetic pattern starts to fade so we take a fresh supply. He lives here but he's free to come and go as he pleases.,True,Attack of the Clones
813,LAMA SU,Apart from his pay which is considerable Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it?,True,Attack of the Clones
814,OBI-WAN,Unaltered?,True,Attack of the Clones
815,LAMA SU,Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...,True,Attack of the Clones

820,OBI-WAN,You mentioned growth acceleration...,True,Attack of the Clones
821,LAMA SU,Oh yes it's essential. Otherwise a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago when Sido-dyas first placed the order and they're already mature...,True,Attack of the Clones
823,OBI-WAN,And these?,True,Attack of the Clones
824,LAMA SU,About five years ago.,True,Attack of the Clones

1112,MACE WINDU ,Be careful Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?,True,Attack of the Clones

1115,BAIL ORGANA,The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.,True,Attack of the Clones
1116,PALPATINE,Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.,True,Attack of the Clones
1117,MACE WINDU ,We must stop them soon before they're fully ready.,True,Attack of the Clones
1118,SENATOR ASK AAK,The debate is over we need that clone army now!,True,Attack of the Clones
1119,BAIL ORGANA,Unfortunately the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.,True,Attack of the Clones
1121,MAS AMEDDA,This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers he could approve the use of the army in a minute.,True,Attack of the Clones
1122,PALPATINE,Please please I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda how many are available to go to Geonosis?,True,Attack of the Clones
1124,YODA,Two Hundred... less or more.,True,Attack of the Clones
1125,BAIL ORGANA,With all due respect for the Jedi Order two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.,True,Attack of the Clones
1126,MACE WINDU ,Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance it's speculation.,True,Attack of the Clones
1127,SENATOR ASK AAK,But we must prepare for the worst. I'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!,True,Attack of the Clones
1128,PALPATINE,Out of the question Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.,True,Attack of the Clones
1129,MAS AMEDDA,If only Senator Amidala were here.,True,Attack of the Clones
1131,JAR JAR,Supreme Chancellor... my august colleagues I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation and I'm sure Senator Amidala and the Queen of Naboo would agree.,True,Attack of the Clones

1166,ANAKIN,Yeah you're right you're right.,True,Attack of the Clones
1169,MACE WINDU ,We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you Anakin is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.,True,Attack of the Clones
1170,ANAKIN,Understood Master.,True,Attack of the Clones
1172,PADME,They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look Geonosis is less than a parsec away.,True,Attack of the Clones
1174,ANAKIN,If he's still alive.,True,Attack of the Clones
1175,PADME,Annie are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...,True,Attack of the Clones

1179,PADME, ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me you will have to come along.,True,Attack of the Clones
1184,MACE WINDU ,The longer we wait the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.,True,Attack of the Clones

1199,ORN FREE TAA,We won't support a dictator.,True,Attack of the Clones
1201,JAR JAR,That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties will be restored to us burnished even more brightly than before!,True,Attack of the Clones
1204,PALPATINE,It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term of office is over you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace.,True,Attack of the Clones

1221,THREEPIO,Yes it is Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them I doubt if I ever shall.,True,Attack of the Clones
1224,PADME, It's empty!,True,Attack of the Clones

1236,DOOKU,He has been convicted of espionage Senator and will be executed. In just a few hours I believe.,True,Attack of the Clones
1238,PADME,He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.,True,Attack of the Clones
1239,DOOKU,We don't recognise the Republic here Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance I could easily hear your plea for clemency.,True,Attack of the Clones
1241,PADME,And if I don't join your rebellion I assume this Jedi with me will also die?,True,Attack of the Clones
1242,DOOKU,I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will Senator but you are a rational honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption the bureaucrats the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest Senator.,True,Attack of the Clones

1245,PADME,If what you say is true you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.,True,Attack of the Clones
1246,DOOKU,The Chancellor means well M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever no? Senator the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed called the Republic will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.,True,Attack of the Clones
1247,PADME,I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic.

1249,PADME,What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?,True,Attack of the Clones
1250,DOOKU,I wouldn't think of such an offence. But there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics I'm afraid. It's purely personal and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you.,True,Attack of the Clones
