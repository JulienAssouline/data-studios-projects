24,KRENNIC, Do I huh? You have to start somewhere.,Rogue One
25,GALEN ERSO, I'll be of no help Krennic. My mind just isn't what it was. I have trouble remembering even simple things.,Rogue One

50,CASSIAN, Easy. You have news from Jedha? Come on.,Rogue One
51,TIVIK, An Imperial pilot one of the cargo drivers. He defected yesterday. He's telling people they're making a weapon. The kyber crystals that's what they're for.,Rogue One

58,CASSIAN, Galen Erso? Was it?,Rogue One
59,TIVIK, I don't know! They were looking for Saw when we left.,Rogue One
60,CASSIAN, Who else knows this?,Rogue One
61,TIVIK, I have no idea!It's all falling apart. Saw's right there're spies everywhere.,Rogue One
62,STORMTROOPER, What's all this?,Rogue One
63,STORMTROOPER, Come on let's see some scandocs.,Rogue One
64,CASSIAN, Yeah of course.My gloves?,Rogue One
65,TIVIK,No What've you done?,Rogue One
66,STORMTROOPERS, Troopers down section 9.,Rogue One
67,TIVIK, Are you crazy? I'll never climb out of here. My arm...,Rogue One
70,MILITIA, (Sir.),Rogue One
73,STORMTROOPER, What now?,Rogue One

77,MELSHI, Hallik! Liana Hallik!,Rogue One
78,SOLDIER, Her.,Rogue One
79,MELSHI, You want to get out of here?,Rogue One
80,PRISONER, Hey! What about me?,Rogue One
81,K2-SO, [chokeslamming Jyn for trying to escape]Congratulations.You are being rescued. Please do not resist.,Rogue One
83,PA, LU-28 report to maintenance level 4.,Rogue One
85,CASSIAN, We think you might be able to help us.,Rogue One
86,MON MOTHMA, This is Captain Cassian Andor Rebel Intelligence.,Rogue One
87,CASSIAN, When was the last time you were in contact with your father?,Rogue One
88,JYN ERSO, 15 years ago.,Rogue One
89,CASSIAN, Any idea where he's been all that time?,Rogue One
90,JYN ERSO, I like to think he's dead makes things easier.,Rogue One
91,CASSIAN, Easier than what? That he's being a tool of the Imperial war machine?,Rogue One
92,JYN ERSO, I've never had the luxury of political opinions.,Rogue One
93,CASSIAN, Really? When was your last contact with Saw Gerrera?,Rogue One
94,JYN ERSO, It's been a long time.,Rogue One
96,JYN ERSO, I was a child Saw Gerrera saved my life. He raised me. But I've no idea where he is. I haven't seen him in years.,Rogue One
97,CASSIAN,We know how to find him that's not our problem. What we need is someone who gets us through the door without being killed.,Rogue One
98,JYN ERSO, You're all rebels aren't you?,Rogue One
99,MON MOTHMA, Yes but Saw Gerrera's an extremist. He's been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust.,Rogue One
100,JYN ERSO, What does this have to do with my father?,Rogue One
102,JYN ERSO, And if I do it?,Rogue One
103,MON MOTHMA, We'll make sure you go free.,Rogue One
105,GENERAL DRAVEN, Captain Andor!,Rogue One
106,K2-SO, I'm K-2SO. I'm a reprogrammed Imperial droid.,Rogue One
107,JYN ERSO, I remember you.,Rogue One
108,K2-SO, I see the Council is sending you with us to Jedha.,Rogue One
109,JYN ERSO, Apparently so.,Rogue One
110,K2-SO, That is a bad idea. I think so and so does Cassian. What do I know? My specialty is just strategic analysis.,Rogue One
111,GENERAL DRAVEN, Galen Erso is vital to the Empire's weapon program. Forget what you heard in there there will be no extraction. You find him you kill him.Then and there.,Rogue One
112,CASSIAN,You met Kay-Tu?,Rogue One
113,JYN ERSO, Charming.,Rogue One
114,CASSIAN,He tends to say whatever comes into his circuits. It's a by-product of the reprogram.,Rogue One
115,K2-SO, Why does she get a blaster and I don't?,Rogue One
116,CASSIAN, What.,Rogue One
117,JYN ERSO, I know how to use it.,Rogue One
118,CASSIAN, That's what I'm afraid of. Give it to me.,Rogue One
119,JYN ERSO, We're going to Jedha. That's a war zone.,Rogue One
120,CASSIAN, That's not the point. Where did you get it?,Rogue One
121,JYN ERSO, I found it.,Rogue One
122,K2-SO, I find that answer vague and unconvincing.,Rogue One
123,JYN, Trust goes both ways.,Rogue One
124,K2-SO, You're letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It's high.,Rogue One
125,CASSIAN, Let's get going.,Rogue One
126,K2-SO, It's very high.,Rogue One
128,SAW GERRERA, Lies!Deceptions!Let's see it. Bodhi Rook. Cargo pilot. Local boy huh?,Rogue One
129,BODHI, Uh-huh.,Rogue One
130,MILITIA, (This was found in his boot when he was captured),Rogue One
131,BODHI, Okay I can hear you.He didn't capture meI came here myself.I defected I defected.,Rogue One
132,SAW GERRERA, Every day more lies.,Rogue One
133,BODHI, Lies? Would I risk everything for a lie? No we don't have time for this! I have to speak to Saw Gerrera before it's too late.,Rogue One
134,BODHI, Okay... So you... Um. Uh.That's-That's for you. And I gave it to them they did not find it! I gave it to them. Galen Erso. He told me to find you.,Rogue One
135,SAW GERRERA, Bor Gullet.,Rogue One
136,BODHI, Bor Gullet? Galen Erso sent me! He told me to find you!,Rogue One
138,TARKIN, Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays and now this. We've heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.,Rogue One
139,KRENNIC, When the battle station is finished Governor Tarkin the Senate will be of little concern.,Rogue One
140,TARKIN, When has become now Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience.,Rogue One
141,KRENNIC,I will not fail.,Rogue One
144,LYRA, Galen.,Rogue One
146,CASSIAN,We're coming into orbit.You have controls.,Rogue One
147,CASSIAN, That's Jedha.Or what's left of it. We find Saw we find your father.,Rogue One
148,JYN,What's with the Destroyer?,Rogue One
149,CASSIAN,It's because of your old friend Saw Gerrera. He's been attacking the cargo shipments.,Rogue One
150,JYN,What are they bringing in?,Rogue One
152,JYN ERSO, Maybe we should leave target practice behind.,Rogue One
153,K2-SO, Are you talking about me?,Rogue One
154,CASSIAN,She's right.We need to blend in. Stay with the ship.,Rogue One
155,K2-SO, I can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid. This city is under Imperial occupation,Rogue One
156,JYN ERSO, Half the people here want to reprogram you. The other half want to put a hole in your head.,Rogue One
157,K2-SO, I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.,Rogue One
158,Â JYN ERSO, I'm not. I'm just worried they might miss you and hit me.,Rogue One
159,K2-SO, Doesn't sound so bad to me.,Rogue One
161,SAW GERRERA, Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts No lie is safe.What have you really brought me cargo pilot?Bor Gullet will know the truth.The unfortunate side effect is that one tends to lose one's mind.,Rogue One
162,BODHI, No.,Rogue One
164,DR. EVAZAN, Hey you just watch yourself.,Rogue One
165,CASSIAN, No no.Tourist we don't want any trouble sorry. Come on. Come on.,Rogue One
166,STORMTROOPER, Citizens of Jedhayou must come forward with information of the location of this missing cargo pilot. A reward of 600 credits for the information shall be awarded.,Rogue One
167,CASSIAN, I had a contact one of Saw's rebels but he's just gone missing.His sister will be looking for him. The temple's been destroyed but she'll be there waiting. We'll give her your name and hope that gets us a meeting with Saw.,Rogue One
168,JYN, Hope?,Rogue One
169,CASSIAN, Yeah. Rebellions are built on hope.,Rogue One
170,STORMTROOPER, Hands where I can see them. Get over there. Show me some identification. Check inside.,Rogue One
171,JYN, Is this all because of your pilot?,Rogue One
172,CHIRRUT, May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.,Rogue One
173,CASSIAN, Wait for me.,Rogue One
174,CHIRRUT, May the Force of others be with you. May the Force of others be with you.,Rogue One
175,CHIRRUT, Would you trade that necklace for a glimpse into your future? Yes I'm speaking to you. I am Chirrut Ãmwe.,Rogue One
176,JYN ERSO, How did you know I was wearing a necklace?,Rogue One
177,CHIRRUT, For that answer you must pay. What do you know of kyber crystals?,Rogue One
178,JYN ERSO, My father he said they powered the Jedi lightsabers.,Rogue One
179,CASSIAN, Jyn. Come on let's go.,Rogue One
180,CHIRRUT, The strongest stars have hearts of kyber.,Rogue One
181,CASSIAN, Let's go. We're not here to make friends.,Rogue One
182,JYN ERSO, Who are they?,Rogue One
183,CASSIAN, The Guardians of the Whills. Protectors of the Kyber Temple. But there's nothing left to protect so now they're just causing trouble for everybody.,Rogue One
184,JYN ERSO, You seem awfully tense all of a sudden.,Rogue One
185,CASSIAN, We have to hurry. This town it's ready to blow.,Rogue One
186,STORMTROOPER, Citizens of the Empire Imperial forces...,Rogue One
187,JYN, Tell me you have a backup plan.,Rogue One
188,STORMTROOPER, Incoming.,Rogue One
189,STORMTROOPER, Put your guns down.,Rogue One
190,STORMTROOPER, Behind us.,Rogue One

194,STORMTROOPER, Hit the tower.,Rogue One
195,CITIZEN, Get out of there!,Rogue One
197,K2-SO, Did you know that wasn't me?,Rogue One
198,JYN ERSO, Of course!,Rogue One
199,CASSIAN,I thought I told you to stay on the ship.,Rogue One
200,K2-SO, You did but I thought it was boring and you were in trouble. There are a lot of explosions for two people blending in.,Rogue One
201,STORMTROOPER,Freeze right there...,Rogue One
202,K2-SO, You're right I should just wait on the ship.,Rogue One
203,STORMTROOPER,Halt! Stop right there!,Rogue One
204,STORMTROOPER,Where are you taking these prisoners?,Rogue One
205,K2-SO, These are prisoners.,Rogue One
206,STORMTROOPER, Yes. Where are you taking them?,Rogue One
207,K2-SO, I am taking them... to imprison them. In prison.,Rogue One
208,CASSIAN, He's taking us to...,Rogue One
209,K2-SO, Quiet! And there's a fresh one if you mouth off again!,Rogue One
210,STORMTROOPER, We'll take them from here.,Rogue One
211,K2-SO, That's okay. If you could just point me in the right direction I can take them I'm sure. I've taken them this farâ¦,Rogue One
212,CASSIAN, Hey wait a second.,Rogue One
213,STORMTROOPER, Take them away.,Rogue One
214,K2-SO, Wait!,Rogue One
215,STORMTROOPER, Hey droid.You can't take them away! You stay here. We need to check your diagnostics.,Rogue One
216,K2-SO, Diagnostics? I'm capable of running my own diagnostics thank you very much.,Rogue One
217,CHIRRUT, Let them pass in peace! Let them pass in peace. The Force is with me and I am with the Force. And I fear nothing for all is as the Force wills it.,Rogue One
218,STORMTROOPER, Hey! Stop right there!,Rogue One
220,STORMTROOPER, I said: Stop right there!,Rogue One
221,CHIRRUT, Is your foot all right?,Rogue One
222,CHIRRUT, You almost shot me.,Rogue One
223,BAZE, You're welcome.,Rogue One
224,K2-SO, Clear of hostiles!,Rogue One
225,K2-SO, One hostile!,Rogue One
226,JYN, He's with us!,Rogue One
227,CHIRRUT,They're all right.,Rogue One
228,JYN,Thanks.,Rogue One
229,K2-SO, Cassian I'm sorry about the slap.,Rogue One
230,CASSIAN, Go back to the ship. Wait for my call.,Rogue One
231,CASSIAN, Is he a Jedi?,Rogue One
232,BAZE, There are no Jedi here anymore. Only dreamers like this fool.,Rogue One
233,CHIRRUT, The Force did protect me.,Rogue One
234,BAZE, I protected you.,Rogue One
235,JYN, Can you get us to Saw Gerrera?,Rogue One
238,CHIRRUT, Are you kidding me? I'm blind!,Rogue One
240,CHIRRUT, I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me. I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.,Rogue One
241,BAZE, You pray?,Rogue One
242,CHIRRUT, I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.,Rogue One
243,BAZE, Really?,Rogue One
244,CHIRRUT, I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.,Rogue One
246,CASSIAN, I'm beginning to think the Force and I have different priorities.,Rogue One
247,BAZE, Relax Captain. We've been in worse cages than this one.,Rogue One
248,CASSIAN, This is a first for me.,Rogue One
249,CHIRRUT, There is more than one sort of prison Captain I sense that you carry yours wherever you go.,Rogue One
251,SAW GERRERA, Jyn. Is it really you? I can't believe it.,Rogue One
252,JYN ERSO, Must be quite a surprise.,Rogue One
253,SAW GERRERA, Are we not still friends?,Rogue One
254,JYN ERSO, The last time I saw you you gave me a knife and loaded blaster and told me to wait in a bunker until daylight.,Rogue One
255,SAW GERRERA, I knew you were safe.,Rogue One
256,JYN ERSO, You left me behind.,Rogue One
257,SAW GERRERA, You were already the best soldier in my cadre.,Rogue One
258,JYN ERSO, I was sixteen.,Rogue One
259,SAW GERRERA, I was protecting you!,Rogue One
260,JYN ERSO, You dumped me!,Rogue One
261,SAW GERRERA, You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer! People were starting to figure that out. People who wanted to- to use you as a hostage. Not a day goes by that I don't think of you. But today of all days? It's a trap isn't it?,Rogue One
262,JYN ERSO, What?,Rogue One
263,SAW GERRERA, The pilot! The message. All of it. Did they... send you? Did you come here to kill me? There's not much of me left.,Rogue One
264,JYN ERSO, The Alliance wants my father.They think he's sent you a message about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me you might actually help them out.,Rogue One
265,SAW GERRERA, So what is it that you want Jyn?,Rogue One
266,JYN, They wanted an introduction they've got it. I'm out now. The rest of you can do what you want.,Rogue One
267,SAW GERRERA, You care not about the cause?,Rogue One
268,JYN, The cause? Seriously? The Alliance? The...The rebels? Whatever it is you're calling yourself these days?All it's ever brought me is pain.,Rogue One
269,SAW GERRERA, You can stand to see the Imperial flag reign across the galaxy?,Rogue One
270,JYN, It's not a problem if you don't look up.,Rogue One
271,SAW GERRERA, I have something to show you come.,Rogue One
273,TARKIN, The Emperor is awaiting my report.,Rogue One
274,KRENNIC, One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion.,Rogue One
275,TARKIN, And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.,Rogue One
276,KRENNIC,Your concern is hardly warranted.,Rogue One
277,TARKIN, If saying it would only make it so.,Rogue One
278,KRENNIC,All Imperial forces have been evacuated and I stand ready to destroy the entire moon.,Rogue One
280,OFFICER, Sir we're in position ready to...,Rogue One
281,KRENNIC, Fire!,Rogue One
282,OFFICER, Commence primary ignition.,Rogue One
284,CHIRRUT, Who's the one in the next cell?,Rogue One
285,CASSIAN, What? Where?,Rogue One
286,BAZE, An Imperial pilot.,Rogue One
287,CASSIAN, Pilot?,Rogue One
288,BAZE, I'm going to kill him!,Rogue One
289,CASSIAN, No no No wait!,Rogue One
290,BAZE, Come here!,Rogue One
291,CASSIAN, NO!,Rogue One
292,BAZE, Back off. Back off.,Rogue One
293,CASSIAN, Okay.,Rogue One
294,CASSIAN, Are you the pilot? Hey heyare you the pilot? The shuttle pilot? Pilot?,Rogue One
295,CHIRRUT, What's wrong with him?,Rogue One
296,CASSIAN,Galen Erso. You know that name?,Rogue One
297,BODHI, I brought the message I'm the pilot.I'm the pilot. I'm the pilot.,Rogue One
298,CASSIAN, Okay good. Now where is Galen Erso?,Rogue One
300,OFFICER, Standby.,Rogue One
302,SAW GERRERA, This is the message I was sent.,Rogue One
303,GALEN ERSO, Saw if you're watching this then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance.Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and though I don't dare hope for too much a chance for Jyn if she's alive if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I've missed her. Jyn my Stardust I can't imagine what you think of me. When I was taken I faced some bitter truths. I was told that soon enough Krennic would have you as well. As time went by I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work if I took my own life it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I've placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful they'll never find it. But Jyn. Jyn if you're listening My beloved so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It's just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw the reactor module that's the key. That's the place I've laid my trap. It's well hidden and unstable one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station. You'll need the plans the structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know there's a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station...,Rogue One
304,CASSIAN, Go. Go.,Rogue One
305,CASSIAN, K-2? K-2 where are you?,Rogue One
306,K2-SO, There you are. I'm standing by as you requested. Although there's a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.,Rogue One
307,CASSIAN, Locate our position. Bring that ship in here now!,Rogue One
308,CHIRRUT,Where are you going?,Rogue One
309,CASSIAN, I've got to find Jyn. Get the pilot. We need him.,Rogue One
310,BAZE, All right. I'll get the pilot.,Rogue One
311,BAZE, Pilot.,Rogue One
312,BODHI, No no no.,Rogue One
313,BAZE, Let's go.,Rogue One
314,CASSIAN, Jyn! We've got to go. I know where your father is.,Rogue One
315,SAW GERRERA, Go with him Jyn. You must go.,Rogue One
316,JYN ERSO, Come with us.,Rogue One
317,SAW GERRERA, I will run no longer.,Rogue One
318,CASSIAN, Come on.,Rogue One
319,JYN ERSO, But you must save yourself.,Rogue One
320,CASSIAN, Come on.,Rogue One
321,SAW GERRERA, Go! There's no time! Save the Rebellion! Save the dream!,Rogue One
323,KRENNIC, Oh. It's beautiful.,Rogue One
326,CASSIAN, Get us out of here! Punch it!,Rogue One
327,K2-SO, I'm not very optimistic about our odds.,Rogue One
328,CASSIAN, Let's not K. Come on! Punch it.,Rogue One
329,K2-SO,I haven't completed my calculation.,Rogue One
330,CASSIAN, I'll make them for you.,Rogue One
332,TARKIN,I believe I owe you an apology Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations.,Rogue One
333,KRENNIC, And you'll tell the Emperor as much?,Rogue One
334,TARKIN, I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.,Rogue One
336,KRENNIC, We stand here amid my achievement not yours!,Rogue One
337,TARKIN,I'm afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.,Rogue One
338,KRENNIC, The breaches have been filled Jedha has been silenced.,Rogue One
339,TARKIN,You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso's facility.,Rogue One
340,KRENNIC, We'll see about this.,Rogue One
342,REBEL, A coded message from Captain Andor sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise.,Rogue One
343,GENERAL DRAVEN, Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.,Rogue One
345,CHIRRUT, Baze tell me. All of it? The whole city?Tell me.,Rogue One
346,BODHI, All of it.,Rogue One
347,CASSIAN, Understood. Set a course for Eadu.,Rogue One
348,K2-SO, Setting course for Eadu.,Rogue One
349,JYN, Is that where my father is?,Rogue One
350,CASSIAN, I think so.,Rogue One
351,BODHI, So you're Galen's daughter.,Rogue One
352,JYN, You know him?,Rogue One
353,BODHI, I'm Bodhi the pilot.,Rogue One
354,JYN, You brought the message.,Rogue One
355,BODHI, Yes your father... He said I could get right by myself.He said I could make it right if I was brave enough and listened to what was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late.,Rogue One
356,JYN, It wasn't too late.,Rogue One
357,BODHI, Seems pretty late to me.,Rogue One
358,JYN, No. We can beat the people who did this. My father's message I've seen it.They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there's a way to defeat it. You're wrong about my father.,Rogue One
359,CASSIAN, He did build it.,Rogue One
360,JYN, Because he knew they'd do it without him. My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He's rigged a trap inside it.That's why he sent you. To bring that message.,Rogue One
361,CASSIAN, Where is it? Where's the message?,Rogue One
362,JYN, It was a hologram.,Rogue One
363,CASSIAN, You have that message right?,Rogue One
364,JYN, Everything happened so fast.,Rogue One
365,CASSIAN, Did you see it?,Rogue One
366,JYN, You don't believe me.,Rogue One
367,CASSIAN, I'm not the one you've got to convince.,Rogue One
368,CHIRRUT, I believe her.,Rogue One
369,CASSIAN, That's good to know.,Rogue One
370,BAZE,What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap.,Rogue One
371,JYN, The reactor. He's placed a weakness there. He's been hiding it for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance.,Rogue One
372,CASSIAN, I've done that.,Rogue One
373,JYN, They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing. They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.,Rogue One
374,CASSIAN, I can't risk sending that. We're in the heart of Imperial territory.,Rogue One
375,JYN,Then we'll find him. And bring him back and he can tell them himself.,Rogue One
377,IMPERIAL NAVIGATOR, Course set for Eadu sir.,Rogue One
379,CHIRRUT, I'm one with the Force and the Force is with me.,Rogue One
380,K2-SO, 20 degrees to the right. 10 degrees up.,Rogue One
381,BODHI, No no no lower. Lower!,Rogue One
382,K2-SO, Are you sure this is the way?,Rogue One
383,BODHI, They have landing trackers. They have patrol squadrons. You've got to stay in the canyon keep it low.,Rogue One
384,CASSIAN, Watch your right!,Rogue One
385,K2-SO, There's a 26% chance of failure.,Rogue One
386,CASSIAN, How much farther?,Rogue One
387,BODHI, I don't know. I'm not sure I never really come this way but we're close we're close. I know that.,Rogue One
388,K2-SO, Well now there's a 35% chance of failure.,Rogue One
389,BODHI, I don't want to know thank you.,Rogue One
390,K2-SO, I understand.,Rogue One
391,BODHI, Now! Put it down now!,Rogue One
392,K2-SO, The wind...,Rogue One

404,CASSIAN, Yeah. Where is it?,Rogue One
405,BODHI, It's just over the ridge.,Rogue One
406,CASSIAN, And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us? You are sure of that?,Rogue One
407,BODHI, Yes.We'll have to hope there's still an Imperial ship left to steal. ,Rogue One
408,CASSIAN, Here's what we're doing. Hopefully the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here.Bodhi you're coming with me. We'll go up the ridge and check it out.,Rogue One
409,JYN, I'm coming with you.,Rogue One
410,CASSIAN, No your father's message we can't risk it. You're the messenger.,Rogue One
412,CASSIAN, Get to work fixing our comms!All I want to do right now is get a handle on what we're up against.So we're going to go very small and very carefully up the rise and see what's what. Let's get out of here.,Rogue One
413,CHIRRUT, Does he look like a killer?,Rogue One
414,BAZER, No. He has the face of a friend.,Rogue One
415,JYN, Who are you talking about?,Rogue One
416,CHIRRUT, Captain Andor.,Rogue One
417,JYN, Why do you ask that? What do you mean does he look like a killer?,Rogue One
418,CHIRRUT, The Force moves darkly near a creature that's about to kill.,Rogue One
419,K2-SO, His weapon was in the sniper configuration.,Rogue One
421,BODHI, No no no... We got to go up. You can't see much from down there. ,Rogue One
424,BAZE, Where are you going?,Rogue One
425,CHIRRUT, I'm going to follow Jyn. Her path is clear.,Rogue One
426,BAZE, Alone? Good luck!,Rogue One
427,CHIRRUT, I don't need luck I have you!,Rogue One
428,K2-SO, What are they doing? If Cassian comes back we're leaving without them.,Rogue One
430,CASSIAN, You see Erso out there?,Rogue One

435,BODHI, What are you doing?,Rogue One

497,CASSIAN, Ion thrusters low until we cleared the storm.,Rogue One
498,K2-SO, Understood.,Rogue One
499,JYN, You lied to me.,Rogue One
500,CASSIAN, You're in shock.,Rogue One
501,JYN, You went up there to kill my father.,Rogue One
502,CASSIAN, You don't know what you're talking about.,Rogue One
503,JYN, Deny it.,Rogue One
504,CASSIAN, You're in shock and looking for someplace to put it.,Rogue One
505,JYN, I've seen it before.,Rogue One
506,CASSIAN, I bet you have.,Rogue One
507,JYN, They know.You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone.,Rogue One
508,CASSIAN, I had every chance to pull the trigger. But did I? Did I?,Rogue One
509,JYN, You might as well have. My father was living proof and you put him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed him!,Rogue One
510,CASSIAN, I had orders! Orders that I disobeyed! But you wouldn't understand that.,Rogue One
511,JYN, Orders?When you know they're wrong? You might as well be a stormtrooper.,Rogue One
512,CASSIAN, What do you know? We don't all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I've been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You're not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it.,Rogue One
513,JYN, You can't talk your way around this.,Rogue One
514,CASSIAN, I don't have to. Yavin Four! Make sure they know we're coming in with a stolen ship.,Rogue One
517,VANEE, My lord Director Krennic has arrived.,Rogue One
518,DARTH VADER, Director Krennic.,Rogue One
519,KRENNIC, Lord Vader.,Rogue One
520,DARTH VADER,You seem unsettled.,Rogue One
521,KRENNIC,No. Just pressed for time. There're a great many things to attend to.,Rogue One
522,DARTH VADER,My apologies. You do have a great many things to explain.,Rogue One
523,KRENNIC,I've delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkableâ¦ potential.,Rogue One
524,DARTH VADER,Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked.,Rogue One
525,KRENNIC,It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test.,Rogue One
526,DARTH VADER,You were not summoned here to grovel Director Krennic.,Rogue One
527,KRENNIC, No itâs...,Rogue One
528,DARTH VADER, There is no Death Star. The Senate has been informed that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.,Rogue One
529,KRENNIC,Yes my lord.,Rogue One
530,DARTH VADER,I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way.,Rogue One
531,KRENNIC,So I'm still in command? You'll speak to the Emperor aboutâ¦,Rogue One
532,DARTH VADER,Be careful not to choke on your aspirations Director.,Rogue One
534,PAMLO, We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender.,Rogue One
535,ORGANA, Are we really talking about disbanding something that we've worked so hard to create?,Rogue One
536,RADDUS, We can't just give in.,Rogue One
537,VASPAR, We joined an Alliance not a suicide pact!,Rogue One
538,ORGANA, We've only now managed to gather our forces.,Rogue One
539,JEBEL, Gather our forces? General Draven's already blown up an Imperial base!,Rogue One
540,DRAVEN, A decision needed to be made.,Rogue One
541,PAMLO, If it's war you want you'll fight alone!,Rogue One
542,VASPAR, If that's the way it's going why have an Alliance at all?,Rogue One
543,RADDUS, If she's telling the truth we need to act now!,Rogue One
544,MON MOTHMA, Councilors please!,Rogue One
545,BLUE LEADER, It is simple the Empire has the means of mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.,Rogue One
546,JEBEL, A Death Star this is nonsense.,Rogue One
547,JYN ERSO, What reason would my father have to lie? What benefit would it bring him?,Rogue One
549,JEBEL, Don't forget the Imperial pilot.,Rogue One
550,JYN ERSO, My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this.,Rogue One
551,DODONNA, So you've told us.,Rogue One
552,PAMLO, If the Empire has this kind of power what chance do we have?,Rogue One
553,JYN, What chance do we have? The question is 'What choice?' Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now!,Rogue One
555,REBEL, What is she proposing?,Rogue One
556,REBEL, Just let the girl speak!,Rogue One
557,JYN ERSO, Send your best troops to Scarif.Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it.,Rogue One
558,PAMLO, You're asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope?,Rogue One
559,JYN ERSO, Rebellions are built on hope.,Rogue One
560,VASPAR, There is no hope.,Rogue One
561,RADDUS, I say we fight.,Rogue One
562,JEBEL, I say the Rebellion is finished.,Rogue One
563,MON MOTHMA, I'm sorry Jyn. Without the full support of the council the odds are too great.,Rogue One
565,PA, General Syndulla please report to the briefing room.,Rogue One
566,BAZE,You don't look happy.,Rogue One
567,JYN, They prefer to surrender.,Rogue One
568,BAZE, And you?,Rogue One
569,CHIRRUT, She wants to fight.,Rogue One
570,BODHI, So do I. We all do.,Rogue One
571,CHIRRUT, The Force is strong.,Rogue One
572,JYN, I'm not sure four of us is quite enough.,Rogue One
573,BAZE, How many do we need?,Rogue One
574,JYN, What are you talking about?,Rogue One
575,CASSIAN,They were never going to believe you.,Rogue One
576,JYN, I appreciate the support.,Rogue One
578,CASSIAN, Okay. Gear up. Grab anything that's not nailed down. Go go go!,Rogue One

600,MON MOTHMA, Your friend the Jedi.,Rogue One

602,MON MOTHMA, You'll need someone you can trust.,Rogue One
603,SENATOR ORGANA, I would trust her with my life. Captain Antilles I have a mission for you.,Rogue One
604,CAPTAIN ANTILLES, Senator.,Rogue One
606,BODHI, Okay we're coming in. There's a planetwide defensive shield with a single main entry gate. This shuttle should be equipped with an access code that allows us through.,Rogue One
607,K2-SO, Assuming the Empire hasn't logged it as overdue.,Rogue One
609,BODHI,Thenthey shut the gate and we're all annihilated in the cold dark vacuum of space.,Rogue One

624,CASSIAN, The dish at the top? What's it for?,Rogue One
625,BODHI, I guess it takes a lot of signals to send those data files out.,Rogue One
626,K2-SO, Landing track engaged,Rogue One
627,BODHI, Landing track locked.,Rogue One
628,CASSIAN, We're landing. We're coming in!,Rogue One
629,JYN, Saw Gerrera used to say1 fighter with a sharp stick and nothing left to lose can take the day. They have no idea we're coming. They have no reason to expect us.
