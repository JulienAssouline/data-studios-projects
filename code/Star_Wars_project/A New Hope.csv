18,THREEPIO,Did you hear that? They've shut down                          the main reactor. We'll be destroyed                          for sure. This is madness!,A New Hope

22,THREEPIO,There'll be no escape for the Princess                          this time.,A New Hope
24,THREEPIO,What's that?,A New Hope
31,THREEPIO,I should have known better than to                          trust the logic of a half-sized                          thermocapsulary dehousing assister...,A New Hope
36,LUKE,Hurry up! Come with me! What are you                          waiting for?! Get in gear!,A New Hope
44,THREEPIO,Artoo! Artoo-Detoo where are you?,A New Hope
46,THREEPIO,At last! Where have you been?,A New Hope
48,THREEPIO,They're heading in this direction.                          What are we going to do? We'll be                          sent to the spice mine of Kessel or                          smashed into who knows what!,A New Hope
50,THREEPIO,Wait a minute where are you going?,A New Hope
54,IMPERIAL OFFICER,The Death Star plans are not in the                          main computer.,A New Hope
56,VADER,Where are those transmissions you                          intercepted?,A New Hope
58,VADER,What have you done with those plans?,A New Hope
59,REBEL OFFICER,We intercepted no transmissions.                          Aaah... This is a consular ship.                          Were on a diplomatic mission.,A New Hope
60,VADER,If this is a consular ship... were                          is the Ambassador?,A New Hope
62,VADER,Commander tear this ship apart until                          you've found those plans and bring                          me the Ambassador. I want her alive!,A New Hope
66,TROOPER,There she is! Set for stun!,A New Hope
68,TROOPER,She'll be all right. Inform Lord                          Vader we have a prisoner.,A New Hope
71,THREEPIO,Hey you're not permitted in there.                          It's restricted. You'll be deactivated                          for sure..,A New Hope
73,THREEPIO,Don't call me a mindless philosopher                          you overweight glob of grease! Now                          come out before somebody sees you.,A New Hope
75,THREEPIO,Secret mission? What plans? What are                          you talking about? I'm not getting                          in there!,A New Hope
78,THREEPIO,I'm going to regret this.,A New Hope
81,CHIEF PILOT,There goes another one.,A New Hope
82,CAPTAIN,Hold your fire. There are no life                          forms. It must have been short-                         circuited.,A New Hope
85,THREEPIO,That's funny the damage doesn't                          look as bad from out here.,A New Hope
87,THREEPIO,Are you sure this things safe?,A New Hope
90,WOMAN,I've told you kids to slow down!,A New Hope
93,FIXER,Did I hear a young noise blast through                          here?,A New Hope
94,CAMIE,It was just wormie on another rampage.,A New Hope
96,LUKE,Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?,A New Hope
98,LUKE,I didn't know you were back! When                          did you get in?,A New Hope
99,BIGGS,Just now. I wanted to surprise you                          hot shot. I thought you'd be here...                          certainly didn't expect you to be                          out working.                              (he laughs),A New Hope
100,LUKE,The Academy didn't change you                          much...but you're back so soon? Hey                          what happened didn't you get your                          commission?,A New Hope
102,BIGGS,Of course I got it. Signed aboard                          The Rand Ecliptic last week. First                          mate Biggs Darklighter at your                          service...                              (he salutes)                         ...I just came to say good-bye to                          all you unfortunate landlocked                          simpletons.,A New Hope
104,LUKE,I almost forgot. There's a battle                          going on! Right here in our system.                          Come and look!,A New Hope
105,DEAK,Not again! Forget it.,A New Hope
108,LUKE,There they are!,A New Hope
110,BIGGS,That's no battle hot shot... they're                          just sitting there! Probably a                          freighter-tanker refueling.,A New Hope
111,LUKE,But there was a lot of firing                          earlier...,A New Hope
113,LUKE,Hey easy with those...,A New Hope
114,CAMIE,Don't worry about it Wormie.,A New Hope
116,FIXER,I keep telling you the Rebellion is                          a long way from here. I doubt if the                          Empire would even fight to keep this                          system. Believe me Luke this planet                          is a big hunk of nothing...,A New Hope
120,LEIA,Lord Vader I should have known.                          Only you could be so bold. The                          Imperial Senate will not sit for                          this when they hear you've attacked                          a diplomatic...,A New Hope
121,VADER,Don't play games with me Your                          Highness. You weren't on any mercy                          mission this time. You passed directly                          through a restricted system. Several                          transmissions were beamed to this                          ship by Rebel spies. I want to know                          what happened to the plans they sent                          you.,A New Hope
122,LEIA,I don't know what you're talking                          about. I'm a member of the Imperial                          Senate on a diplomatic mission to                          Alderaan...,A New Hope
123,VADER,You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...                          and a traitor. Take her away!,A New Hope
125,COMMANDER,Holding her is dangerous. If word of                          this gets out it could generate                          sympathy for the Rebellion in the                          senate.,A New Hope
126,VADER,I have traced the Rebel spies to                          her. Now she is my only link to find                          their secret base!,A New Hope
127,COMMANDER,She'll die before she tells you                          anything.,A New Hope
128,VADER,Leave that to me. Send a distress                          signal and then inform the senate                          that all aboard were killed!,A New Hope
130,SECOND OFFICER,Lord Vader the battle station plans                          are not aboard this ship! And no                          transmissions were made. An escape                          pod was jettisoned during the                          fighting but no life forms were                          aboard.,A New Hope
132,VADER,She must have hidden the plans in                          the escape pod. Send a detachment                          down to retrieve them. See to it                          personally Commander. There'll be                          no one to stop us this time.,A New Hope
133,COMMANDER,Yes sir.,A New Hope
138,THREEPIO,How did I get into this mess? I really                          don't know how. We seem to be made                          to suffer. It's our lot in life.,A New Hope
140,THREEPIO,I've got to rest before I fall apart.                          My joints are almost frozen.,A New Hope
142,THREEPIO,What a desolate place this is.,A New Hope
144,THREEPIO,Where are you going?,A New Hope
146,THREEPIO,Well I'm not going that way. It's                          much too rocky. This way is much                          easier.,A New Hope
148,THREEPIO,What makes you think there are                          settlements over there?,A New Hope
150,THREEPIO,Don't get technical with me.,A New Hope
152,THREEPIO,What mission? What are you talking                          about? I've had just about enough of                          you! Go that way! You'll be                          malfunctioning within a day you                          nearsighted scrap pile!,A New Hope
154,THREEPIO,And don't let me catch you following                          me begging for help because you                          won't get it.,A New Hope
156,THREEPIO,No more adventures. I'm not going                          that way.,A New Hope
160,THREEPIO,That malfunctioning little twerp.                          This is all his fault! He tricked me                          into going this way but he'll do no                          better.,A New Hope
162,THREEPIO,Wait what's that? A transport! I'm                          saved!,A New Hope
164,THREEPIO,Over here! Help! Please help!,A New Hope
167,LUKE,(Very animated)                         ...so I cut off my power shut down                          the afterburners and came in low on                          Deak's trail. I was so close I thought                          I was going to fry my instruments.                          As it was I busted up the Skyhopper                          pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty                          upset. He grounded me for the rest                          of the season. You should have been                          there... it was fantastic.,A New Hope
168,BIGGS,You ought to take it easy Luke. You                          may be the hottest bushpilot this                          side of Mos Eisley but those little                          Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it                          up and one day whammo you're going                          to be nothing more than a dark spot                          on the down side of a canyon wall.,A New Hope
169,LUKE,Look who's talking. Now that you've                          been around those giant starships                          you're beginning to sound like my                          uncle. You've gotten soft in the                          city...,A New Hope
170,BIGGS,I've missed you kid.,A New Hope
171,LUKE,Well things haven't been the same                          since you left Biggs. It's been                          so... quiet.,A New Hope
173,BIGGS,Luke I didn't come back just to say                          good-bye... I shouldn't tell you                          this but you're the only one I can                          trust... and if I don't come back I                          want somebody to know.,A New Hope
175,LUKE,What are you talking about?,A New Hope
176,BIGGS,I made some friends at the Academy.                              (he whispers)                         ...when our frigate goes to one of                          the central systems we're going to                          jump ship and join the Alliance...,A New Hope
178,LUKE,Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding!                          How?,A New Hope
179,BIGGS,Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth                          bigger than a meteor crater!,A New Hope
180,LUKE,I'm sorry. I'm quiet.                              (he whispers)                         Listen how quiet I am. You can barely                          hear me...,A New Hope
182,BIGGS,My friend has a friend on Bestine                          who might help us make contact.,A New Hope
183,LUKE,You're crazy! You could wander around                          forever trying to find them.,A New Hope
184,BIGGS,I know it's a long shot but if I                          don't find them I'll do what I can                          on my own... It's what we always                          talked about. Luke I'm not going to                          wait for the Empire to draft me into                          service. The Rebellion is spreading                          and I want to be on the right side --                          the side I believe in.,A New Hope
185,LUKE,And I'm stuck here...,A New Hope
186,BIGGS,I thought you were going to the                          Academy next term. You'll get your                          chance to get off this rock.,A New Hope
187,LUKE,Not likely! I had to cancel my                          application. There has been a lot of                          unrest among the Sandpeople since                          you left... they've even raided the                          outskirts of Anchorhead.,A New Hope
188,BIGGS,Your uncle could hold off a whole                          colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.,A New Hope
189,LUKE,I know but he's got enough vaporators                          going to make the place pay off. He                          needs me for just one more season. I                          can't leave him now.,A New Hope
190,BIGGS,I feel for you Luke you're going                          to have to learn what seems to be                          important or what really is important.                          What good is all your uncle's work                          if it's taken over by the Empire?...                          You know they're starting to                          nationalize commerce in the central                          systems... it won't be long before                          your uncle is merely a tenant slaving                          for the greater glory of the Empire.,A New Hope
191,LUKE,It couldn't happen here. You said it                          yourself. The Empire won't bother                          with this rock.,A New Hope
192,BIGGS,Things always change.,A New Hope
193,LUKE,I wish I was going... Are you going                          to be around long?,A New Hope
194,BIGGS,No I'm leaving in the morning...,A New Hope
195,LUKE,Then I guess I won't see you.,A New Hope
196,BIGGS,Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.,A New Hope
197,LUKE,Well I'll be at the Academy next                          season... after that who knows. I                          won't be drafted into the Imperial                          Starfleet that's for sure... Take                          care of yourself you'll always be                          the best friend I've got.,A New Hope
198,BIGGS,So long Luke.,A New Hope
211,THREEPIO,Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!,A New Hope
217,FIRST TROOPER,Someone was in the pod. The tracks                          go off in this direction.,A New Hope
219,SECOND TROOPER,Look sir -- droids.,A New Hope
224,THREEPIO,Wake up! Wake up!,A New Hope
226,THREEPIO,We're doomed.,A New Hope
228,THREEPIO,Do you think they'll melt us down?,A New Hope
230,THREEPIO,Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this                          never end?,A New Hope
236,BERU,Luke tell Owen that if he gets a                          translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.,A New Hope
237,LUKE,It looks like we don't have much of                          a choice but I'll remind him.,A New Hope
239,OWEN,I have no need for a protocol droid.,A New Hope
240,THREEPIO,(quickly)                         Sir -- not in an environment such as                          this -- that's why I've also been                          programmed for over thirty secondary                          functions that...,A New Hope
241,OWEN,What I really need is a droid that                          understands the binary language of                          moisture vaporators.,A New Hope
242,THREEPIO,Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was                          programming binary load lifter...                          very similar to your vaporators. You                          could say...,A New Hope
243,OWEN,Do you speak Bocce?,A New Hope
244,THREEPIO,Of course I can sir. It's like a                          second language for me... I'm as                          fluent in Bocce...,A New Hope
245,OWEN,All right shut up!                              (turning to Jawa)                         I'll take this one.,A New Hope
246,THREEPIO,Shutting up sir.,A New Hope
247,OWEN,Luke take these two over to the                          garage will you? I want you to have                          both of them cleaned up before dinner.,A New Hope
248,LUKE,But I was going into Toshi Station                          to pick up some power converters...,A New Hope
249,OWEN,You can waste time with your friends                          when your chores are done. Now come                          on get to it!,A New Hope
250,LUKE,All right come on! And the red one                          come on. Well come on Red let's                          go.,A New Hope
253,LUKE,Uncle Owen...,A New Hope
254,OWEN,Yeah?,A New Hope
255,LUKE,This R2 unit has a bad motivator.                          Look!,A New Hope
256,OWEN,(to the head Jawa)                         Hey what're you trying to push on                          us?,A New Hope
258,THREEPIO,(pointing to Artoo)                         Excuse me sir but that R2 unit is                          in prime condition. A real bargain.,A New Hope
259,LUKE,Uncle Owen...,A New Hope
260,OWEN,Yeah?,A New Hope
261,LUKE,What about that one?,A New Hope
262,OWEN,(to Jawa)                         What about that blue one? We'll take                          that one.,A New Hope
264,LUKE,Yeah take it away.,A New Hope
265,THREEPIO,Uh I'm quite sure you'll be very                          pleased with that one sir. He really                          is in first-class condition. I've                          worked with him before. Here he comes.,A New Hope
267,LUKE,Okay let's go.,A New Hope
268,THREEPIO,(to Artoo)                         Now don't you forget this! Why I                          should stick my neck out for you is                          quite beyond my capacity!,A New Hope
271,THREEPIO,Thank the maker! This oil bath is                          going to feel so good. I've got such                          a bad case of dust contamination I                          can barely move!,A New Hope
273,LUKE,It just isn't fair. Oh Biggs is                          right. I'm never gonna get out of                          here!,A New Hope
274,THREEPIO,Is there anything I might do to help?,A New Hope
276,LUKE,Well not unless you can alter time                          speed up the harvest or teleport me                          off this rock!,A New Hope
277,THREEPIO,I don't think so sir. I'm only a                          droid and not very knowledgeable                          about such things. Not on this planet                          anyways. As a matter of fact I'm                          not even sure which planet I'm on.,A New Hope
278,LUKE,Well if there's a bright center to                          the universe you're on the planet                          that it's farthest from.,A New Hope
279,THREEPIO,I see sir.,A New Hope
280,LUKE,Uh you can call me Luke.,A New Hope
281,THREEPIO,I see sir Luke.,A New Hope
282,LUKE,(laughing)                         Just Luke.,A New Hope
283,THREEPIO,And I am See-Threepio human-cyborg                          relations and this is my counterpart                          Artoo-Detoo.,A New Hope
284,LUKE,Hello.,A New Hope
286,LUKE,You got a lot of carbon scoring here.                          It looks like you boys have seen a                          lot of action.,A New Hope
287,THREEPIO,With all we've been through sometimes                          I'm amazed we're in as good condition                          as we are what with the Rebellion                          and all.,A New Hope
288,LUKE,You know of the Rebellion against                          the Empire?,A New Hope
289,THREEPIO,That's how we came to be in your                          service if you take my meaning                          sir.,A New Hope
290,LUKE,Have you been in many battles?,A New Hope
291,THREEPIO,Several I think. Actually there's                          not much to tell. I'm not much more                          than an interpreter and not very                          good at telling stories. Well not                          at making them interesting anyways.,A New Hope
293,LUKE,Well my little friend you've got                          something jammed in here real good.                          Were you on a cruiser or...,A New Hope
295,LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my                          only hope.,A New Hope
296,LUKE,What's this?,A New Hope
298,THREEPIO,What is what?!? He asked you a                          question...                              (pointing to Leia)                         What is that?,A New Hope
300,LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my                          only hope. Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi.                          You're my only hope.,A New Hope
301,THREEPIO,Oh he says it's nothing sir. Merely                          a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no                          mind.,A New Hope
303,LUKE,Who is she? She's beautiful.,A New Hope
304,THREEPIO,I'm afraid I'm not quite sure sir.,A New Hope
305,LEIA,Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi...,A New Hope
306,THREEPIO,I think she was a passenger on our                          last voyage. A person of some                          importance sir -- I believe. Our                          captain was attached to...,A New Hope
307,LUKE,Is there more to this recording?,A New Hope
309,THREEPIO,Behave yourself Artoo. You're going                          to get us in trouble. It's all right                          you can trust him. He's our new                          master.,A New Hope
311,THREEPIO,He says he's the property of Obi-Wan                          Kenobi a resident of these parts.                          And it's a private message for him.                          Quite frankly sir I don't know what                          he's talking about. Our last master                          was Captain Antilles but with what                          we've been through this little R2                          unit has become a bit eccentric.,A New Hope
312,LUKE,Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means                          old Ben Kenobi?,A New Hope
313,THREEPIO,I beg your pardon sir but do you                          know what he's talking about?,A New Hope
314,LUKE,Well I don't know anyone named Obi-                         Wan but old Ben lives out beyond                          the dune sea. He's kind of a strange                          old hermit.,A New Hope
316,LUKE,I wonder who she is. It sounds like                          she's in trouble. I'd better play                          back the whole thing.,A New Hope
318,THREEPIO,He says the restraining bolt has                          short circuited his recording system.                          He suggests that if you remove the                          bolt he might be able to play back                          the entire recording.,A New Hope
320,LUKE,H'm? Oh yeah well I guess you're                          too small to run away on me if I                          take this off! Okay.,A New Hope
322,LUKE,There you go.,A New Hope
324,LUKE,Well wait a minute. Where'd she go?                          Bring her back! Play back the entire                          message.,A New Hope
326,THREEPIO,What message? The one you're carrying                          inside your rusty innards!,A New Hope
328,AUNT BERU,Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!,A New Hope
330,LUKE,All right I'll be right there Aunt                          Beru.,A New Hope
331,THREEPIO,I'm sorry sir but he appears to                          have picked up a slight flutter.,A New Hope
333,LUKE,Well see what you can do with him.                          I'll be right back.,A New Hope
334,THREEPIO,(to Artoo)                         Just you reconsider playing that                          message for him.,A New Hope
336,THREEPIO,No I don't think he likes you at                          all.,A New Hope
338,THREEPIO,No I don't like you either.,A New Hope
342,LUKE,You know I think that R2 unit we                          bought might have been stolen.,A New Hope
343,OWEN,What makes you think that?,A New Hope
344,LUKE,Well I stumbled across a recording                          while I was cleaning him. He says he                          belongs to someone called Obi-Wan                          Kenobi.,A New Hope
346,LUKE,I thought he might have meant old                          Ben. Do you know what he's talking                          about? Well I wonder if he's related                          to Ben.,A New Hope
348,OWEN,That old man's just a crazy old                          wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take                          that R2 unit into Anchorhead and                          have its memory flushed. That'll be                          the end of it. It belongs to us now.,A New Hope
349,LUKE,But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking                          for him?,A New Hope
350,OWEN,He won't I don't think he exists                          any more. He died about the same                          time as your father.,A New Hope
351,LUKE,He knew my father?,A New Hope
352,OWEN,I told you to forget it. Your only                          concern is to prepare the new droids                          for tomorrow. In the morning I want                          them on the south ridge working out                          those condensers.,A New Hope
353,LUKE,Yes sir. I think those new droids                          are going to work out fine. In fact                          I uh was also thinking about our                          agreement about my staying on another                          season. And if these new droids do                          work out I want to transmit my                          application to the Academy this year.,A New Hope
355,OWEN,You mean the next semester before                          harvest?,A New Hope
356,LUKE,Sure there're more than enough                          droids.,A New Hope
357,OWEN,Harvest is when I need you the most.                          Only one more season. This year we'll                          make enough on the harvest so I'll                          be able to hire some more hands. And                          then you can go to the Academy next                          year.,A New Hope
359,OWEN,You must understand I need you here                          Luke.,A New Hope
360,LUKE,But it's a whole 'nother year.,A New Hope
361,OWEN,Look it's only one more season.,A New Hope
363,LUKE,Yeah that's what you said last year                          when Biggs and Tank left.,A New Hope
364,AUNT BERU,Where are you going?,A New Hope
365,LUKE,It looks like I'm going nowhere. I                          have to finish cleaning those droids.,A New Hope
367,AUNT BERU,Owen he can't stay here forever.                          Most of his friends have gone. It                          means so much to him.,A New Hope
368,OWEN,I'll make it up to him next year. I                          promise.,A New Hope
369,AUNT BERU,Luke's just not a farmer Owen. He                          has too much of his father in him.,A New Hope
370,OWEN,That's what I'm afraid of.,A New Hope
375,LUKE,What are you doing hiding there?,A New Hope
377,THREEPIO,It wasn't my fault sir. Please don't                          deactivate me. I told him not to go                          but he's faulty malfunctioning;                          kept babbling on about his mission.,A New Hope
378,LUKE,Oh no!,A New Hope
382,THREEPIO,That R2 unit has always been a                          problem. These astro-droids are                          getting quite out of hand. Even I                          can't understand their logic at times.,A New Hope
383,LUKE,How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere                          in sight. Blast it!,A New Hope
384,THREEPIO,Pardon me sir but couldn't we go                          after him?,A New Hope
385,LUKE,It's too dangerous with all the                          Sandpeople around. We'll have to                          wait until morning.,A New Hope
387,OWEN,Luke I'm shutting the power down                          for the night.,A New Hope
388,LUKE,All right I'll be there in a few                          minutes. Boy am I gonna get it.,A New Hope
390,LUKE,You know that little droid is going                          to cause me a lot of trouble.,A New Hope
391,THREEPIO,Oh he excels at that sir.,A New Hope
394,OWEN,Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be                          loafing now!,A New Hope
397,OWEN,Have you seen Luke this morning?,A New Hope
398,AUNT BERU,He said he had some things to do                          before he started today so he left                          early.,A New Hope
399,OWEN,Uh? Did he take those two new droids                          with him?,A New Hope
400,AUNT BERU,I think so.,A New Hope
401,OWEN,Well he'd better have those units                          in the south range repaired be midday                          or there'll be hell to pay!,A New Hope
406,LUKE,(yelling)                         How's that.,A New Hope
408,LUKE,Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this                          direction somewhere but I don't see                          how that R2 unit could have come                          this far. We must have missed him.                          Uncle Owen isn't going to take this                          very well.,A New Hope
409,THREEPIO,Sir would it help if you told him                          it was my fault.,A New Hope
410,LUKE,(brightening)                         Sure. He needs you. He'd probably                          only deactivate you for a day or                          so...,A New Hope
411,THREEPIO,Deactivate! Well on the other hand                          if you hadn't removed his restraining                          bolt...,A New Hope
412,LUKE,Wait there's something dead ahead                          on the scanner. It looks like our                          droid... hit the accelerator.,A New Hope
420,LUKE,Hey whoa just where do you think                          you're going?,A New Hope
422,THREEPIO,Master Luke here is your rightful                          owner. We'll have no more of this                          Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't                          talk to me about your mission either.                          You're fortunate he doesn't blast                          you into a million pieces right here.,A New Hope
423,LUKE,Well come on. It's getting late. I                          only hope we can get back before                          Uncle Owen really blows up.,A New Hope
424,THREEPIO,If you don't mind my saying so sir                          I think you should deactivate the                          little fugitive until you've gotten                          him back to your workshop.,A New Hope
425,LUKE,No he's not going to try anything.,A New Hope
427,LUKE,What's wrong with him now?,A New Hope
428,THREEPIO,Oh my... sir he says there are                          several creatures approaching from                          the southeast.,A New Hope
430,LUKE,Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on let's                          have a look. Come on.,A New Hope
433,LUKE,There are two Banthas down there but                          I don't see any... wait a second                          they're Sandpeople all right. I can                          see one of them now.,A New Hope
439,BEN,Hello there! Come here my little                          friend. Don't be afraid.,A New Hope
441,BEN,Don't worry he'll be all right.,A New Hope
442,LUKE,What happened?,A New Hope
443,BEN,Rest easy son you've had a busy                          day. You're fortunate you're still                          in one piece.,A New Hope
444,LUKE,Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy am I glad to                          see you!,A New Hope
445,BEN,The Jundland wastes are not to be                          traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke                          what brings you out this far?,A New Hope
446,LUKE,Oh this little droid! I think he's                          searching for his former master...                          I've never seen such devotion in a                          droid before... there seems to be no                          stopping him. He claims to be the                          property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he                          a relative of yours? Do you know who                          he's talking about?,A New Hope
448,BEN,Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats                          a name I haven't heard in a long                          time... a long time.,A New Hope
449,LUKE,I think my uncle knew him. He said                          he was dead.,A New Hope
450,BEN,Oh he's not dead not... not yet.,A New Hope
451,LUKE,You know him!,A New Hope
452,BEN,Well of course of course I know                          him. He's me! I haven't gone by the                          name Obi-Wan since oh before you                          were born.,A New Hope
453,LUKE,Then the droid does belong to you.,A New Hope
454,BEN,Don't seem to remember ever owning a                          droid. Very interesting...,A New Hope
456,BEN,I think we better get indoors. The                          Sandpeople are easily startled but                          they will soon be back and in greater                          numbers.,A New Hope
458,LUKE,Threepio!,A New Hope
462,THREEPIO,Where am I? I must have taken a bad                          step...,A New Hope
463,LUKE,Can you stand? We've got to get out                          of here before the Sandpeople return.,A New Hope
464,THREEPIO,I don't think I can make it. You go                          on Master Luke. There's no sense in                          you risking yourself on my account.                          I'm done for.,A New Hope
466,LUKE,No you're not. What kind of talk is                          that?,A New Hope
468,BEN,Quickly son... they're on the move.,A New Hope
471,LUKE,No my father didn't fight in the                          wars. He was a navigator on a spice                          freighter.,A New Hope
472,BEN,That's what your uncle told you. He                          didn't hold with your father's ideals.                          Thought he should have stayed here                          and not gotten involved.,A New Hope
473,LUKE,You fought in the Clone Wars?,A New Hope
474,BEN,Yes I was once a Jedi Knight the                          same as your father.,A New Hope
475,LUKE,I wish I'd known him.,A New Hope
476,BEN,He was the best star-pilot in the                          galaxy and a cunning warrior. I                          understand you've become quite a                          good pilot yourself. And he was a                          good friend. Which reminds me...,A New Hope
478,BEN,I have something here for you. Your                          father wanted you to have this when                          you were old enough but your uncle                          wouldn't allow it. He feared you                          might follow old Obi-Wan on some                          damned-fool idealistic crusade like                          your father did.,A New Hope
479,THREEPIO,Sir if you'll not be needing me                          I'll close down for awhile.,A New Hope
480,LUKE,Sure go ahead.,A New Hope
482,LUKE,What is it?,A New Hope
483,BEN,Your fathers lightsaber. This is the                          weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy                          or as random as a blaster.,A New Hope
485,BEN,An elegant weapon for a more civilized                          time. For over a thousand generations                          the Jedi Knights were the guardians                          of peace and justice in the Old                          Republic. Before the dark times                          before the Empire.,A New Hope
487,LUKE,How did my father die?,A New Hope
488,BEN,A young Jedi named Darth Vader who                          was a pupil of mine until he turned                          to evil helped the Empire hunt down                          and destroy the Jedi Knights. He                          betrayed and murdered your father.                          Now the Jedi are all but extinct.                          Vader was seduced by the dark side                          of the Force.,A New Hope
489,LUKE,The Force?,A New Hope
490,BEN,Well the Force is what gives a Jedi                          his power. It's an energy field                          created by all living things. It                          surrounds us and penetrates us. It                          binds the galaxy together.,A New Hope
492,BEN,Now let's see if we can't figure                          out what you are my little friend.                          And where you come from.,A New Hope
493,LUKE,I saw part of the message he was...,A New Hope
495,BEN,I seem to have found it.,A New Hope
497,LEIA,General Kenobi years ago you served                          my father in the Clone Wars. Now he                          begs you to help him in his struggle                          against the Empire. I regret that I                          am unable to present my father's                          request to you in person but my                          ship has fallen under attack and I'm                          afraid my mission to bring you to                          Alderaan has failed. I have placed                          information vital to the survival of                          the Rebellion into the memory systems                          of this R2 unit. My father will know                          how to retrieve it. You must see                          this droid safely delivered to him                          on Alderaan. This is our most                          desperate hour. Help me Obi-Wan                          Kenobi you're my only hope.,A New Hope
499,BEN,You must learn the ways of the Force                          if you're to come with me to Alderaan.,A New Hope
500,LUKE,(laughing)                         Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.                          I've got to go home. It's late I'm                          in for it as it is.,A New Hope
501,BEN,I need your help Luke. She needs                          your help. I'm getting too old for                          this sort of thing.,A New Hope
502,LUKE,I can't get involved! I've got work                          to do! It's not that I like the                          Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing                          I can do about it right now. It's                          such a long way from here.,A New Hope
503,BEN,That's your uncle talking.,A New Hope
504,LUKE,(sighing)                         Oh God my uncle. How am I ever                          going to explain this?,A New Hope
505,BEN,Learn about the Force Luke.,A New Hope
506,LUKE,Look I can take you as far as                          Anchorhead. You can get a transport                          there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're                          going.,A New Hope
507,BEN,You must do what you feel is right                          of course.,A New Hope
512,TAGGE,Until this battle station is fully                          operational we are vulnerable. The                          Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.                          They're more dangerous than you                          realize.,A New Hope
514,MOTTI,Dangerous to your starfleet                          Commander not to this battle station!,A New Hope
515,TAGGE,The Rebellion will continue to gain                          a support in the Imperial Senate as                          long as....,A New Hope
517,TARKIN,The Imperial Senate will no longer                          be of any concern to us. I've just                          received word that the Emperor has                          dissolved the council permanently.                          The last remnants of the Old Republic                          have been swept away.,A New Hope
518,TAGGE,That's impossible! How will the                          Emperor maintain control without the                          bureaucracy?,A New Hope
519,TARKIN,The regional governors now have direct                          control over territories. Fear will                          keep the local systems in line. Fear                          of this battle station.,A New Hope
520,TAGGE,And what of the Rebellion? If the                          Rebels have obtained a complete                          technical readout of this station                          it is possible however unlikely                          that they might find a weakness and                          exploit it.,A New Hope
521,VADER,The plans you refer to will soon be                          back in our hands.,A New Hope
522,MOTTI,Any attack made by the Rebels against                          this station would be a useless                          gesture no matter what technical                          data they've obtained. This station                          is now the ultimate power in the                          universe. I suggest we use it!,A New Hope
523,VADER,Don't be too proud of this                          technological terror you've                          constructed. The ability to destroy                          a planet is insignificant next to                          the power of the Force.,A New Hope
524,MOTTI,Don't try to frighten us with your                          sorcerer's ways Lord Vader. Your                          sad devotion to that ancient religion                          has not helped you conjure up the                          stolen data tapes or given you                          clairvoyance enough to find the                          Rebel's hidden fort...,A New Hope
526,VADER,I find your lack of faith disturbing.,A New Hope
527,TARKIN,Enough of this! Vader release him!,A New Hope
528,VADER,As you wish.,A New Hope
529,TARKIN,This bickering is pointless. Lord                          Vader will provide us with the                          location of the Rebel fortress by                          the time this station is operational.                          We will then crush the Rebellion                          with one swift stroke.,A New Hope
532,LUKE,It looks like Sandpeople did this                          all right. Look here are Gaffi                          sticks Bantha tracks. It's just...                          I never heard of them hitting anything                          this big before.,A New Hope
534,BEN,They didn't. But we are meant to                          think they did. These tracks are                          side by side. Sandpeople always ride                          single file to hide there numbers.,A New Hope
535,LUKE,These are the same Jawas that sold                          us Artoo and Threepio.,A New Hope
536,BEN,And these blast points too accurate                          for Sandpeople. Only Imperial                          stormtroopers are so precise.,A New Hope
537,LUKE,Why would Imperial troops want to                          slaughter Jawas?,A New Hope
539,LUKE,If they traced the robots here they                          may have learned who they sold them                          to. And that would lead them home!,A New Hope
541,BEN,Wait Luke! It's too dangerous.,A New Hope
547,LUKE,Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!,A New Hope
553,VADER,And now Your Highness we will                          discuss the location of your hidden                          Rebel base.,A New Hope
557,BEN,There's nothing you could have done                          Luke had you been there. You'd have                          been killed too and the droids                          would be in the hands of the Empire.,A New Hope
558,LUKE,I want to come with you to Alderaan.                          There's nothing here for me now. I                          want to learn the ways of the Force                          and become a Jedi like my father.,A New Hope
561,BEN,Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never                          find a more wretched hive of scum                          and villainy. We must be cautious.,A New Hope
565,TROOPER,How long have you had these droids?,A New Hope
566,LUKE,About three or four seasons.,A New Hope
567,BEN,They're for sale if you want them.,A New Hope
568,TROOPER,Let me see your identification.,A New Hope
570,BEN,You don't need to see his                          identification.,A New Hope
571,TROOPER,We don't need to see his                          identification.,A New Hope
572,BEN,These are not the droids your looking                          for.,A New Hope
573,TROOPER,These are not the droids we're looking                          for.,A New Hope
574,BEN,He can go about his business.,A New Hope
575,TROOPER,You can go about your business.,A New Hope
576,BEN,(to Luke)                         Move along.,A New Hope
577,TROOPER,Move along. Move along.,A New Hope
580,THREEPIO,I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting                          creatures.,A New Hope
582,LUKE,Go on go on. I can't understand how                          we got by those troopers. I thought                          we were dead.,A New Hope
583,BEN,The Force can have a strong influence                          on the weak-minded. You will find it                          a powerful ally.,A New Hope
584,LUKE,Do you really think we're going to                          find a pilot here that'll take us to                          Alderaan?,A New Hope
585,BEN,Well most of the best freighter                          pilots can be found here. Only watch                          your step. This place can be a little                          rough.,A New Hope

590,BARTENDER,We don't serve their kind here!,A New Hope
592,LUKE,What?,A New Hope
593,BARTENDER,Your droids. They'll have to wait                          outside. We don't want them here.,A New Hope
596,LUKE,Listen why don't you wait out by                          the speeder. We don't want any                          trouble.,A New Hope

607,HUMAN,I don't like you either.,A New Hope
609,HUMAN,Don't insult us. You just watch                          yourself. We're wanted men. I have                          the death sentence in twelve systems.,A New Hope
610,LUKE,I'll be careful than.,A New Hope
611,HUMAN,You'll be dead.,A New Hope
613,BEN,This little one isn't worth the                          effort. Come let me buy you                          something...,A New Hope
615,BARTENDER,No blasters! No blaster!,A New Hope
617,BEN,This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate                          on a ship that might suit our needs.,A New Hope
620,THREEPIO,I don't like the look of this.,A New Hope
623,HAN,Han Solo. I'm captain of the                          Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells                          me you're looking for passage to the                          Alderaan system.,A New Hope
624,BEN,Yes indeed. If it's a fast ship.,A New Hope
625,HAN,Fast ship? You've never heard of the                          Millennium Falcon?,A New Hope
626,BEN,Should I have?,A New Hope
627,HAN,It's the ship that made the Kessel                          run in less than twelve parsecs!,A New Hope
629,HAN,I've outrun Imperial starships not                          the local bulk-cruisers mind you.                          I'm talking about the big Corellian                          ships now. She's fast enough for                          you old man. What's the cargo?,A New Hope
630,BEN,Only passengers. Myself the boy                          two droids and no questions asked.,A New Hope
631,HAN,What is it? Some kind of local                          trouble?,A New Hope
632,BEN,Let's just say we'd like to avoid                          any Imperial entanglements.,A New Hope
633,HAN,Well that's the trick isn't it?                          And it's going to cost you something                          extra. Ten thousand in advance.,A New Hope
634,LUKE,Ten thousand? We could almost buy                          our own ship for that!,A New Hope
635,HAN,But who's going to fly it kid! You?,A New Hope
636,LUKE,You bet I could. I'm not such a bad                          pilot myself! We don't have to sit                          here and listen...,A New Hope
637,BEN,We haven't that much with us. But we                          could pay you two thousand now plus                          fifteen when we reach Alderaan.,A New Hope
638,HAN,Seventeen huh!,A New Hope
640,HAN,Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.                          We'll leave as soon as you're ready.                          Docking bay Ninety-four.,A New Hope

646,HAN,Seventeen thousand! Those guys must                          really be desperate. This could really                          save my neck. Get back to the ship                          and get her ready.,A New Hope
648,BEN,You'll have to sell your speeder.,A New Hope
649,LUKE,That's okay. I'm never coming back                          to this planet again.,A New Hope
652,GREEDO,Going somewhere Solo?,A New Hope
653,HAN,Yes Greedo. As a matter of fact I                          was just going to see your boss.                          Tell Jabba that I've got his money.,A New Hope
655,GREEDO,It's too late. You should have paid                          him when you had the chance. Jabba's                          put a price on your head so large                          that every bounty hunter in the galaxy                          will be looking for you. I'm lucky I                          found you first.,A New Hope
656,HAN,Yeah but this time I got the money.,A New Hope
657,GREEDO,If you give it to me I might forget                          I found you.,A New Hope
658,HAN,I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...,A New Hope
659,GREEDO,Jabba's through with you. He has no                          time for smugglers who drop their                          shipments at the first sign of an                          Imperial cruiser.,A New Hope
660,HAN,Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you                          think I had a choice?,A New Hope
662,GREEDO,You can tell that to Jabba. He may                          only take your ship.,A New Hope
663,HAN,Over my dead body.,A New Hope
664,GREEDO,That's the idea. I've been looking                          forward to killing you for a long                          time.,A New Hope
665,HAN,Yes I'll bet you have.,A New Hope
667,HAN,Sorry about the mess.,A New Hope
671,VADER,Her resistance to the mind probe is                          considerable. It will be some time                          before we can extract any information                          from her.,A New Hope
673,IMPERIAL OFFICER,The final check-out is complete. All                          systems are operational. What course                          shall we set?,A New Hope
674,TARKIN,Perhaps she would respond to an                          alternative form of persuasion.,A New Hope
675,VADER,What do you mean?,A New Hope
676,TARKIN,I think it is time we demonstrate                          the full power of this station.                              (to soldier)                         Set your course for Princess Leia's                          home planet of Alderaan.,A New Hope

684,THREEPIO,I would much rather have gone with                          Master Luke than stay here with you.                          I don't know what all the trouble is                          about but I'm sure it must be your                          fault.,A New Hope
686,THREEPIO,You watch your language!,A New Hope
689,LUKE,He says it's the best he can do.                          Since the XP-38 came out they're                          just not in demand.,A New Hope
690,BEN,It will be enough.,A New Hope
692,BEN,If the ship's as fast as he's                          boasting we ought to do well.,A New Hope

697,HAN,I've been waiting for you Jabba.,A New Hope
698,JABBA,I expected you would be.,A New Hope
699,HAN,I'm not the type to run.,A New Hope
700,JABBA,(fatherly-smooth)                         Han my boy there are times when                          you disappoint me... why haven't you                          paid me? And why did you have to fry                          poor Greedo like that... after all                          we've been through together.,A New Hope
701,HAN,You sent Greedo to blast me.,A New Hope
702,JABBA,(mock surprise)                         Han why you're the best smuggler in                          the business. You're too valuable to                          fry. He was only relaying my concern                          at your delays. He wasn't going to                          blast you.,A New Hope
703,HAN,I think he thought he was. Next time                          don't send one of those twerps. If                          you've got something to say to me                          come see me yourself.,A New Hope
704,JABBA,Han Han! If only you hadn't had to                          dump that shipment of spice... you                          understand I just can't make an                          exception. Where would I be if every                          pilot who smuggled for me dumped                          their shipment at the first sign of                          an Imperial starship? It's not good                          business.,A New Hope
705,HAN,You know even I get boarded                          sometimes Jabba. I had no choice                          but I've got a charter now and I can                          pay you back plus a little extra. I                          just need some more time.,A New Hope
706,JABBA,(to his men)                         Put your blasters away. Han my boy                          I'm only doing this because you're                          the best and I need you. So for an                          extra say twenty percent I'll give                          you a little more time... but this                          is it. If you disappoint me again                          I'll put a price on your head so                          large you won't be able to go near a                          civilized system for the rest of                          your short life.,A New Hope

712,LUKE,What a piece of junk.,A New Hope
714,HAN,She'll make point five beyond the                          speed of light. She may not look                          like much but she's got it where it                          counts kid. I've added some special                          modifications myself.,A New Hope
716,HAN,We're a little rushed so if you'll                          hurry aboard we'll get out of here.,A New Hope
722,THREEPIO,Hello sir.,A New Hope
725,TROOPER,Which way?,A New Hope
727,TROOPER,All right men. Load your weapons!,A New Hope

737,THREEPIO,Oh my. I'd forgotten how much I                          hate space travel.,A New Hope
746,HAN,It looks like an Imperial cruiser.                          Our passengers must be hotter than I                          thought. Try and hold them off. Angle                          the deflector shield while I make                          the calculations for the jump to                          light speed.,A New Hope
751,HAN,Stay sharp! There are two more coming                          in; they're going to try to cut us                          off.,A New Hope
752,LUKE,Why don't you outrun them? I thought                          you said this thing was fast.,A New Hope
753,HAN,Watch your mouth kid or you're                          going to find yourself floating home.                          We'll be safe enough once we make                          the jump to hyperspace. Besides I                          know a few maneuvers. We'll lose                          them!,A New Hope
758,HAN,Here's where the fun begins!,A New Hope
759,BEN,How long before you can make the                          jump to light speed?,A New Hope
760,HAN,It'll take a few moments to get the                          coordinates from the navi-computer.,A New Hope
762,LUKE,Are you kidding? At the rate they're                          gaining...,A New Hope
763,HAN,Traveling through hyperspace isn't                          like dusting crops boy! Without                          precise calculations we could fly                          right through a star or bounce too                          close to a supernova and that'd end                          your trip real quick wouldn't it?,A New Hope
765,LUKE,What's that flashing?,A New Hope
766,HAN,We're losing our deflector shield.                          Go strap yourself in I'm going to                          make the jump to light speed.,A New Hope

779,TARKIN,Princess Leia before your execution                          I would like you to be my guest at a                          ceremony that will make this battle                          station operational. No star system                          will dare oppose the Emperor now.,A New Hope

781,TARKIN,Not after we demonstrate the power                          of this station. In a way you have                          determined the choice of the planet                          that'll be destroyed first. Since                          you are reluctant to provide us with                          the location of the Rebel base I                          have chosen to test this station's                          destructive power... on your home                          planet of Alderaan.,A New Hope

791,LEIA,What?,A New Hope
792,TARKIN,You're far too trusting. Dantooine                          is too remote to make an effective                          demonstration. But don't worry. We                          will deal with your Rebel friends                          soon enough.,A New Hope

800,BEN,I felt a great disturbance in the                          Force... as if millions of voices                          suddenly cried out in terror and                          were suddenly silenced. I fear                          something terrible has happened.,A New Hope

804,HAN,Well you can forget your troubles                          with those Imperial slugs. I told                          you I'd outrun 'em.,A New Hope
806,HAN,Don't everyone thank me at once.,A New Hope
808,HAN,Anyway we should be at Alderaan                          about oh-two-hundred hours.,A New Hope
810,THREEPIO,Now be careful Artoo.,A New Hope
812,THREEPIO,He made a fair move. Screaming about                          it won't help you.,A New Hope
813,HAN,(interrupting)                         Let him have it. It's not wise to                          upset a Wookiee.,A New Hope
814,THREEPIO,But sir nobody worries about                          upsetting a droid.,A New Hope
815,HAN,That's 'cause droids don't pull                          people's arms out of their socket                          when they lose. Wookiees are known                          to do that.,A New Hope
816,THREEPIO,I see your point sir. I suggest a                          new strategy Artoo. Let the Wookiee                          win.,A New Hope
818,BEN,Remember a Jedi can feel the Force                          flowing through him.,A New Hope
819,LUKE,You mean it controls your actions?,A New Hope
820,BEN,Partially. But it also obeys your                          commands.,A New Hope
822,HAN,Hokey religions and ancient weapons                          are no match for a good blaster at                          your side kid.,A New Hope
823,LUKE,You don't believe in the Force do                          you?,A New Hope
824,HAN,Kid I've flown from one side of                          this galaxy to the other. I've seen                          a lot of strange stuff but I've                          never seen anything to make me believe                          there's one all-powerful force                          controlling everything. There's no                          mystical energy field that controls                          my destiny.,A New Hope
826,HAN,It's all a lot of simple tricks and                          nonsense.,A New Hope
827,BEN,I suggest you try it again Luke.,A New Hope
829,BEN,This time let go your conscious                          self and act on instinct.,A New Hope
830,LUKE,(laughing)                         With the blast shield down I can't                          even see. How am I supposed to fight?,A New Hope
831,BEN,Your eyes can deceive you. Don't                          trust them.,A New Hope
833,BEN,Stretch out with your feelings.,A New Hope
835,BEN,You see you can do it.,A New Hope
836,HAN,I call it luck.,A New Hope
837,BEN,In my experience there's no such                          thing as luck.,A New Hope
838,HAN,Look going good against remotes is                          one thing. Going good against the                          living? That's something else.,A New Hope
840,HAN,Looks like we're coming up on                          Alderaan.,A New Hope
842,LUKE,You know I did feel something. I                          could almost see the remote.,A New Hope
843,BEN,That's good. You have taken your                          first step into a larger world.,A New Hope
846,TARKIN,Yes.,A New Hope
847,OFFICER CASS,Our scout ships have reached                          Dantooine. They found the remains of                          a Rebel base but they estimate that                          it has been deserted for some time.                          They are now conducting an extensive                          search of the surrounding systems.,A New Hope
848,TARKIN,She lied! She lied to us!,A New Hope
849,VADER,I told you she would never consciously                          betray the Rebellion.,A New Hope
850,TARKIN,Terminate her... immediately!,A New Hope
854,HAN,Stand by Chewie here we go. Cut in                          the sublight engines.,A New Hope
856,HAN,What the...? Aw we've come out of                          hyperspace into a meteor shower.                          Some kind of asteroid collision.                          It's not on any of the charts.,A New Hope
858,LUKE,What's going on?,A New Hope
859,HAN,Our position is correct except...                          no Alderaan!,A New Hope
860,LUKE,What do you mean? Where is it?,A New Hope
861,HAN,Thats what I'm trying to tell you                          kid. It ain't there. It's been totally                          blown away.,A New Hope
862,LUKE,What? How?,A New Hope
864,BEN,Destroyed... by the Empire!,A New Hope
865,HAN,The entire starfleet couldn't destroy                          the whole planet. It'd take a thousand                          ships with more fire power than                          I've...,A New Hope
867,HAN,There's another ship coming in.,A New Hope
868,LUKE,Maybe they know what happened.,A New Hope
869,BEN,It's an Imperial fighter.,A New Hope
871,LUKE,It followed us!,A New Hope
872,BEN,No. It's a short range fighter.,A New Hope
873,HAN,There aren't any bases around here.                          Where did it come from?,A New Hope
877,LUKE,It sure is leaving in a big hurry.                          If they identify us we're in big                          trouble.,A New Hope
878,HAN,Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam                          it's transmissions.,A New Hope
879,BEN,It'd be as well to let it go. It's                          too far out of range.,A New Hope
880,HAN,Not for long...,A New Hope
885,BEN,A fighter that size couldn't get                          this deep into space on its own.,A New Hope
886,LUKE,It must have gotten lost been part                          of a convoy or something.,A New Hope
887,HAN,Well he ain't going to be around                          long enough to tell anyone about us.,A New Hope
892,LUKE,Look at him. He's headed for that                          small moon.,A New Hope
893,HAN,I think I can get him before he gets                          there... he's almost in range.,A New Hope
895,BEN,That's no moon! It's a space station.,A New Hope
896,HAN,It's too big to be a space station.,A New Hope
897,LUKE,I have a very bad feeling about this.,A New Hope
898,HAN,Yeah I think your right. Full                          reverse! Chewie lock in the auxiliary                          power.,A New Hope
900,LUKE,Why are we still moving towards it?,A New Hope
901,HAN,We're caught in a tractor beam! It's                          pulling us in!,A New Hope
902,LUKE,But there's gotta be something you                          can do!,A New Hope
903,HAN,There's nothin' I can do about it                          kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to                          have to shut down. But they're not                          going to get me without a fight!,A New Hope
905,BEN,You can't win. But there are                          alternatives to fighting.,A New Hope
914,OFFICER,To you stations!                              (to another officer)                         Come with me.,A New Hope
919,OFFICER,Close all outboard shields! Close                          all outboard shields!,A New Hope
922,TARKIN,Yes.,A New Hope
923,VOICE,(over intercom)                         We've captured a freighter entering                          the remains of the Alderaan system.                          It's markings match those of a ship                          that blasted its way out of Mos                          Eisley.,A New Hope
924,VADER,They must be trying to return the                          stolen plans to the princess. She                          may yet be of some use to us.,A New Hope
927,VOICE,(over intercom)                         Unlock one-five-seven and nine.                          Release charges.,A New Hope
928,OFFICER,(to Vader)                         There's no one on board sir.                          According to the log the crew                          abandoned ship right after takeoff.                          It must be a decoy sir. Several of                          the escape pods have been jettisoned.,A New Hope
929,VADER,Did you find any droids?,A New Hope
930,OFFICER,No sir. If there were any on board                          they must also have jettisoned.,A New Hope
931,VADER,Send a scanning crew on board. I                          want every part of this ship checked.,A New Hope
932,OFFICER,Yes sir.,A New Hope
933,VADER,I sense something... a presence I                          haven't felt since...,A New Hope
935,OFFICER,Get me a scanning crew in here on                          the double. I want every part of                          this ship checked!,A New Hope
938,LUKE,Boy it's lucky you had these                          compartments.,A New Hope
939,HAN,I use them for smuggling. I never                          thought I'd be smuggling myself in                          them. This is ridiculous. Even if I                          could take off I'd never get past                          the tractor beam.,A New Hope
940,BEN,Leave that to me!,A New Hope
941,HAN,Damn fool. I knew that you were going                          to say that!,A New Hope
942,BEN,Who's the more foolish... the fool                          or the fool who follows him?,A New Hope
946,TROOPER,The ship's all yours. If the scanners                          pick up anything report it                          immediately. All right let's go.,A New Hope
948,HAN'S VOICE,Hey down there could you give us a                          hand with this?,A New Hope
952,GANTRY OFFICER,TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at                          your post? TX-four-one-two do you                          copy?,A New Hope
954,GANTRY OFFICER,Take over. We've got a bad                          transmitter. I'll see what I can do.,A New Hope
956,LUKE,You know between his howling and                          your blasting everything in sight                          it's a wonder the whole station                          doesn't know we're here.,A New Hope
957,HAN,Bring them on! I prefer a straight                          fight to all this sneaking around.,A New Hope
958,THREEPIO,We found the computer outlet sir.,A New Hope
960,BEN,Plug in. He should be able to                          interpret the entire Imperial computer                          network.,A New Hope
962,THREEPIO,He says he's found the main computer                          to power the tractor beam that's                          holding the ship here. He'll try to                          make the precise location appear on                          the monitor.,A New Hope
964,THREEPIO,The tractor beam is coupled to the                          main reactor in seven locations. A                          power loss at one of the terminals                          will allow the ship to leave.,A New Hope
966,BEN,I don't think you boys can help. I                          must go alone.,A New Hope
967,HAN,Whatever you say. I've done more                          that I bargained for on this trip                          already.,A New Hope
968,LUKE,I want to go with you.,A New Hope
969,BEN,Be patient Luke. Stay and watch                          over the droids.,A New Hope
970,LUKE,But he can...,A New Hope
971,BEN,They must be delivered safely or                          other star systems will suffer the                          same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny                          lies along a different path than                          mine. The Force will be with you...                          always!,A New Hope
973,HAN,Boy you said it Chewie.,A New Hope
975,HAN,Where did you dig up that old fossil?,A New Hope
976,LUKE,Ben is a great man.,A New Hope
977,HAN,Yeah great at getting us into                          trouble.,A New Hope
978,LUKE,I didn't hear you give any ideas...,A New Hope
979,HAN,Well anything would be better than                          just hanging around waiting for him                          to pick us up...,A New Hope
980,LUKE,Who do you think...,A New Hope
982,LUKE,What is it?,A New Hope
983,THREEPIO,"I'm afraid I'm not quite sure sir.                          He says ""I found her"" and keeps                          repeating ""She's here.""",A New Hope
984,LUKE,Well who... who has he found?,A New Hope
986,THREEPIO,Princess Leia.,A New Hope

988,HAN,Princess? What's going on?,A New Hope
989,THREEPIO,Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-                         three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to                          be terminated.,A New Hope
990,LUKE,Oh no! We've got to do something.,A New Hope
991,HAN,What are you talking about?,A New Hope
992,LUKE,The droid belongs to her. She's the                          one in the message... We've got to                          help her.,A New Hope
993,HAN,Now look don't get any funny ideas.                          The old man wants us to wait right                          here.,A New Hope
994,LUKE,But he didn't know she was here.                          Look will you just find a way back                          into the detention block?,A New Hope
995,HAN,I'm not going anywhere.,A New Hope
996,LUKE,They're going to execute her. Look                          a few minutes ago you said you didn't                          want to just wait here to be captured.                          Now all you want to do is stay.,A New Hope
997,HAN,Marching into the detention area is                          not what I had in mind.,A New Hope
998,LUKE,But they're going to kill her!,A New Hope
999,HAN,Better her than me...,A New Hope
1000,LUKE,She's rich.,A New Hope
1002,HAN,Rich?,A New Hope
1003,LUKE,Yes. Rich powerful! Listen if you                          were to rescue her the reward would                          be...,A New Hope
1004,HAN,What?,A New Hope
1005,LUKE,Well more wealth that you can imagine.,A New Hope

1010,HAN,All right kid. But you'd better be                          right about this.,A New Hope
1012,LUKE,All right.,A New Hope
1013,HAN,What's your plan?,A New Hope
1014,LUKE,Uh... Threepio hand me those binders                          there will you?,A New Hope
1016,LUKE,Okay. Now I'm going to put these on                          you.,A New Hope
1018,LUKE,Okay. Han you put these on.,A New Hope
1020,HAN,Don't worry Chewie. I think I know                          what he has in mind.,A New Hope
1022,THREEPIO,Master Luke sir! Pardon me for                          asking... but ah... what should                          Artoo and I do if we're discovered                          here?,A New Hope

1457,LEIA,We did it!,A New Hope
1460,THREEPIO,Help! I think I'm melting!                              (to Artoo)                         This is all your fault.,A New Hope
1466,TARKIN,Are they away?,A New Hope
1467,VADER,They have just made the jump into                          hyperspace.,A New Hope
1468,TARKIN,You're sure the homing beacon is                          secure aboard their ship? I'm taking                          an awful risk Vader. This had better                          work.,A New Hope
1471,HAN,Not a bad bit of rescuing huh? You                          know sometimes I even amaze myself.,A New Hope
1472,LEIA,That doesn't sound too hard. Besides                          they let us go. It's the only                          explanation for the ease of our                          escape.,A New Hope
1473,HAN,Easy... you call that easy?,A New Hope
1474,LEIA,Their tracking us!,A New Hope
1475,HAN,Not this ship sister.,A New Hope
1477,LEIA,At least the information in Artoo is                          still intact.,A New Hope
1478,HAN,What's so important? What's he                          carrying?,A New Hope
1479,LEIA,The technical readouts of that battle                          station. I only hope that when the                          data is analyzed a weakness can be                          found. It's not over yet!,A New Hope
1480,HAN,It is for me sister! Look I ain't                          in this for your revolution and I'm                          not in it for you Princess. I expect                          to be well paid. I'm in it for the                          money!,A New Hope
1481,LEIA,You needn't worry about your reward.                          If money is all that you love then                          that's what you'll receive!,A New Hope
1483,LEIA,Your friend is quite a mercenary. I                          wonder if he really cares about                          anything... or anyone.,A New Hope

1487,HAN,I'm trying not to kid!,A New Hope
1488,LUKE,(under his breath)                         Good...,A New Hope
1489,HAN,Still she's got a lot of spirit. I                          don't know what do you think? Do                          you think a princess and a guy like                          me...,A New Hope
1490,LUKE,No!,A New Hope
1503,WILLARD,(holding Leia)                         You're safe! We had feared the worst.,A New Hope
1505,WILLARD,When we heard about Alderaan we                          were afraid that you were... lost                          along with your father.,A New Hope
1506,LEIA,We don't have time for our sorrows                          Commander. The battle station has                          surely tracked us here.                              (looking pointedly to                               Han)                         It's the only explanation for the                          ease of our escape. You must use the                          information in this R2 unit to plan                          the attack. It is our only hope.,A New Hope
1511,TARKIN,Yes.,A New Hope
1518,DODONNA,The battle station is heavily shielded                          and carries a firepower greater than                          half the star fleet. It's defenses                          are designed around a direct large-                         scale assault. A small one-man fighter                          should be able to penetrate the outer                          defense.,A New Hope
1520,GOLD LEADER,Pardon me for asking sir but what                          good are snub fighters going to be                          against that?,A New Hope
1521,DODONNA,Well the Empire doesn't consider a                          small one-man fighter to be any                          threat or they'd have a tighter                          defense. An analysis of the plans                          provided by Princess Leia has                          demonstrated a weakness in the battle                          station.,A New Hope
1523,DODONNA,The approach will not be easy. You                          are required to maneuver straight                          down this trench and skim the surface                          to this point. The target area is                          only two meters wide. It's a small                          thermal exhaust port right below                          the main port. The shaft leads                          directly to the reactor system. A                          precise hit will start a chain                          reaction which should destroy the                          station.,A New Hope
1525,DODONNA,Only a precise hit will set up a                          chain reaction. The shaft is ray-                         shielded so you'll have to use proton                          torpedoes.,A New Hope
1527,WEDGE,That's impossible even for a                          computer.,A New Hope
1528,LUKE,It's not impossible. I used to bull's-                         eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back                          home. They're not much bigger than                          two meters.,A New Hope
1529,DODONNA,Man your ships! And may the Force be                          with you!,A New Hope
1537,VADER,This will be a day long remembered.                          It has seen the end of Kenobi and it                          will soon see the end of the                          Rebellion.,A New Hope

1542,LUKE,So... you got your reward and you're                          just leaving then?,A New Hope
1543,HAN,That's right yeah! I got some old                          debts I've got to pay off with this                          stuff. Even if I didn't you don't                          think I'd be fool enough to stick                          around here do you? Why don't you                          come with us? You're pretty good in                          a fight. I could use you.,A New Hope
1544,LUKE,(getting angry)                         Come on! Why don't you take a look                          around? You know what's about to                          happen what they're up against.                          They could use a good pilot like                          you. You're turning your back on                          them.,A New Hope
1545,HAN,What good's a reward if you ain't                          around to use it? Besides attacking                          that battle station ain't my idea of                          courage. It's more like suicide.,A New Hope
1546,LUKE,All right. Well take care of                          yourself Han. I guess that's what                          you're best at isn't it?,A New Hope
1548,HAN,Hey Luke... may the Force be with                          you!,A New Hope

1555,LUKE,Oh it's Han! I don't know I really                          thought he'd change his mind.,A New Hope
