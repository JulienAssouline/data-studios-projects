1,CORDÉ,... I'm sorry m'lady... I'm... not sure I... ,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8
2,AMIDALA,No!... No!... No!...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
3,AMIDALA,I should not have come back.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
4,CAPTAIN TYPHO,M'Lady you are still in danger.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
5,CAPTAIN TYPHO,This vote is very important. You did your duty and Cordé did hers. Now come.  M'Lady please!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
6,MAS AMEDDA,Order! We shall have order! The motion for the Republic to commission an army takes precedent and that is what we will vote on at this time.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
7,PALPATINE,...My esteemed colleagues excuse me... I have just received some tragic and disturbing news. Senator Amidala of the Naboo system... Has been assassinated!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
8,PALPATINE, This grievous blow is especially personal to me. Before I became Chancellor I served Amidala when she was Queen. She was a great leader who fought for justice not only in this honourable assembly but also on her home planet. She was so loved she could have been elected queen for life. She believed in public service and she fervently believed in democracy. Her death is a great loss to us all. We will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom... and as a dear friend.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,88
9,SENATOR ASK AAK,How many more Senators will die before this civil strife ends! We must confront these rebels now and they need an army to do it.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,25
10,AMBASSADOR DARSANA,Why weren't the Jedi able to stop this assassination? We are no longer safe under their protection.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
11,ORN FREE TAA,The Republic needs more security now! Before it comes to war.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
12,PALPATINE,Must I remind the Senator from Malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists. Peace is our objective here... not war.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
13,AMIDALA,My noble colleagues I concur with the Supreme Chancellor. At all costs we do not want war!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,17
14,PALPATINE,It is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the Senator from Naboo Padmé Amidala.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
15,PADME,Less than an hour ago an assassination attempt was made against my life. One of my bodyguards and six  others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered. I was the target but more importantly I believe this security measure before you was the target. I have led the opposition to build an army... but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure it's passage...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,67
16,PADME,  I warn you if you vote to create this army war will follow. I have experienced the misery of war  first-hand; I do not wish to do it again.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,29
17,PADME,Wake up Senators... you must wake up! If you offer the separatists violence they can only show us violence in return! Many will lose their lives. All will lose their freedom. This decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great Republic. I pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision. Vote down this security measure which is nothing less than a declaration of war! Does anyone here want that? I cannot believe they do.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,81
18,ORN FREE TAA,My motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first. That is the rule of law.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
19,PALPATINE,Due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion we will take up these matters tomorrow. Until then the Senate stands adjourned.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,26
20,PALPATINE,I don't know how much longer I can hold off the vote my friends. More and more star systems are joining the separatists.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
21,MACE WINDU ,If they do break away -,True,Attack of the Clones,,6
22,PALPATINE,No! I will not let that happen!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
23,MACE WINDU ,But if they do you must realise there aren't enough Jedi to protect the Republic. We are keepers of the peace not soldiers.,True,Attack of the Clones,,23
24,PALPATINE,Master Yoda do you think it will really come to war?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
25,YODA,Worse than war I fear... Much worse. ,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
26,PALPATINE,What?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
27,MACE WINDU ,What do you sense Master?,True,Attack of the Clones,,5

33,MACE WINDU ,Our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of Naboo.,True,Attack of the Clones,,12
34,PADME,I don't wish to disagree but I think that Count Dooku was behind it.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14
35,MACE WINDU ,You know M'Lady Count Dooku was once a Jedi. He wouldn't assassinate anyone it is not in his character.,True,Attack of the Clones,,19
36,KI-ADI-MUNDI,He is a political idealist not a murderer.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
37,YODA,In dark times nothing is what it appears to be but the fact remains Senator in grave danger you are.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,20
38,PALPATINE,Count Dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict. It appears he has no desire to start a war. Why would he kill you? To what end?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
39,PADME,I don't know but everything in my being tells me he was behind it... ,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14
40,PALPATINE,Master Jedi may I suggest that the Senator be placed under the protection of your graces.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
41,BAIL ORGANA,Do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
42,PADME,Chancellor if I may comment I do not believe the...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,10
43,PALPATINE,"...""situation is that serious."" No but I do Senator.",True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9
44,PADME,Chancellor please! I don't want any more guards!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8
45,PALPATINE,I realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you but perhaps someone you are familiar with... an old friend like... Master Kenobi...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,26
46,MACE WINDU ,That's possible. He has just returned from a Border dispute on Ansion.,True,Attack of the Clones,,12
47,PALPATINE,You must remember him M'Lady... he watched over you during the blockade conflict.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,13
48,PADME,This is not necessary Chancellor.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
49,PALPATINE,Do it for me M'Lady please. I will rest easier. We had a big scare today. The thought of losing you is unbearable.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
50,MACE WINDU ,I will have Obi-Wan report to you immediately M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones,,9
51,YODA,Too little about yourself you worry Senator and too much about politics. Be mindful of your danger Padmé. Accept our help.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
52,PALPATINE,I will not like this Republiv that has stood for over a thousand years be split in two,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,18
53,JAR JAR,Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
54,OBI-WAN,It's Good to see you too Jar Jar.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
55,JAR JAR,Oops! Wheresa mesa manners? Excuse me Master Obi-Wan. I completely forgot myself for a moment there. I have had to learn Diplodiaclect... speak it like a native now. Don't really see the point actually but members of the Senate seem to prefer it...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,43

59,JAR JAR,Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh dear I'm afraid I've forgotten myself again.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
60,OBI-WAN,It's a great pleasure to see you again M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9
61,PADME,It has been far too long Master Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths have crossed again... but I must warn you that I think your presence here is unnecessary.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,29
62,OBI-WAN,I'm sure the Jedi Council have their reasons.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
63,PADME,Annie??  My goodness you've grown.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
64,ANAKIN, So have you... grown more beautiful I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator I mean.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
65,PADME,Oh Annie you'll always be that little boy I knew on Tatooine.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,12
66,OBI-WAN,Our presence will be invisible M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
67,CAPTAIN TYPHO,I am very grateful you are here Master Kenobi. The situation is more dangerous than the Senator will admit.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,19
68,PADME,I don't need more security I need answers. I want to know who is trying to kill me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,18
69,OBI-WAN, We're here to protect you Senator not to start an investigation.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11

73,OBI-WAN,We are not going through this exercise again Anakin. You will pay attention to my lead.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
74,ANAKIN,Why?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
75,OBI-WAN,What??!!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
76,ANAKIN,Why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer? Protection is a job for local security... not Jedi. It's overkill Master. Investigation is implied in our mandate.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,34
77,OBI-WAN,We will do as the Council has instructed and you will learn your place young one.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
78,PADME,Perhaps with merely your presence the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed.  Now if you will excuse me I will retire.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,22

84,ANAKIN,Yes my master.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
85,MACE WINDU ,Why couldn't we see this attack on the Senator?,True,Attack of the Clones,,9
86,YODA,Masking the future is this disturbance in the Force.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9
87,MACE WINDU ,The propecy is coming true the Dark Side is growing.,True,Attack of the Clones,,10
88,YODA,And only those who have turned to the Dark Side can sense the possibilities of the future. Only going through the Dark Side can we see.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,26
89,MACE WINDU ,It's been ten years and the Sith still have no shown themselves. Do you think they are behind this?,True,Attack of the Clones,,19

92,YODA,Only if he chooses to follow his destiny.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
93,OBI-WAN,Captain Typho has more than enough men downstairs. No assassin will try that way. Any activity up here?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,18
94,ANAKIN,Quiet as a tomb. I don't like just waiting here for something to happen to her.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
95,OBI-WAN,What's going on?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
96,ANAKIN,She covered that camera. I don't think she liked me watching her.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,12
97,OBI-WAN,What is she thinking?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
98,ANAKIN,She programmed Artoo to warn us if there's an intruder.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
99,OBI-WAN,It's not an intruder I'm worried about. There are many other ways to kill a Senator.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
100,ANAKIN,I know but we also want to catch this assassin. Don't we Master?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,13
101,OBI-WAN,You're using her as bait??,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
102,ANAKIN,It was her idea... No harm will come to her. I can sense everything going on in that room. Trust me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21

110,OBI-WAN,Dreams pass in time.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
111,ANAKIN,I'd rather dream of Padmé. Just Being around her again is... intoxicating.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,12
112,OBI-WAN,Mind your thoughts Anakin they betray you. You've made a commitment to the Jedi order... a commitment not easily broken... and don't forget she's a politician. They're not to be trusted.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,31
113,ANAKIN,She's not like the others in the Senate Master.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9
114,OBI-WAN,It's been my experience that Senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns... and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,32
115,ANAKIN,Not another lecture Master. Not on the economics of politics.... It's too early in the morning... and besides you're generalising. The Chancellor doesn't appear to be corrupt.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
116,OBI-WAN,Palpatine's a politician I've observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the Senators.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,19

120,OBI-WAN,I have a bad feeling about this.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
121,ANAKIN,That was wacky! I almost lost you in the traffic.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
122,OBI-WAN,What took you so long?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
123,ANAKIN,Oh you know Master I couldn't find a speeder I really liked with an open cockpit... and with the right speed capabilities... and then you know I had to get a really gonzo color...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,34
124,OBI-WAN,If you'd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit young Padawan you would rival Master Yoda as a swordsman.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
125,ANAKIN,I thought I already did.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
126,OBI-WAN,Only in your mind my very young apprentice. Careful!! Hey easy!!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
127,ANAKIN,Sorry I forgot you don't like flying Master.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
128,OBI-WAN,I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
129,ANAKIN,Master you know I've been flying since before I could walk. I'm very good at this.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
130,OBI-WAN,Just slow down!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3

154,OBI-WAN, It was stupid!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3

219,ANAKIN,Annie...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
220,PADME,I've always called you that... it is your name isn't it?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,11
221,ANAKIN,It's Anakin. When you say Annie it's like I'm still a little boy... and I'm not.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
222,PADME,I'm sorry Anakin. It's impossible to deny you've...  ...that you've grown up.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,12
223,ANAKIN,Master Obi-Wan manages not to see it...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
224,PADME,Mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. It's the only way we grow.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,20
225,ANAKIN,Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is a great mentor. As wise as Master Yoda and as powerful as Master Windu. I am truly thankful to be his apprentice. Only... although I'm a Padawan learner in some ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead of him. I'm ready for the trials. I know I am! He knows it too. He believes I'm too unpredictable... Other Jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... I know I started my training late... but he won't let me move on.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,89
226,PADME,That must be frustrating.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
227,ANAKIN,It's worse... he's overly critical. He never listens! He just doesn't understand! It's not fair!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,15
228,PADME,I'm sorry... You sounded exactly like that little boy I once knew when he didn't get his way.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,18
229,ANAKIN,I'm not whining! I'm not.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
230,PADME,I didn't say it to hurt you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
231,ANAKIN,I know...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
232,PADME,Anakin...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,1
233,PADME, Don't try to grow up too fast.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
234,ANAKIN,I am grown up. You said it yourself.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
235,PADME,Please don't look at me like that.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
236,ANAKIN,Why not?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
237,PADME,Because I can see what you're thinking.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
238,ANAKIN, Ahh... so you have Jedi powers too?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
239,PADME,It makes me feel uncomfortable.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
240,ANAKIN,Sorry M'lady.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
241,CAPTAIN TYPHO,Be safe m'lady.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
242,PADME,Thank you Captain. Take good care of Dorme... the threat's on you two now.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14
243,DORME,He'll be safe with me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
244,PADME,You'll be fine.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
245,DORME,It's not me M'Lady. I worry about you. What if they realise I'm not you?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,15
246,PADME, Then my Jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,13
247,OBI-WAN,Anakin you stay put on Naboo. Do not attract any attention. Do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the Council.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,22
248,ANAKIN,Yes Master.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
249,OBI-WAN, I will get to the bottom of this plot quickly M'Lady. You'll be back here in no time.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,18
250,PADME,I will be most grateful for your speed Master Jedi.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,10
251,ANAKIN,Time to go.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
252,PADME,I know. ,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,2
253,OBI-WAN,May the Force be with you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
254,ANAKIN,May the Force be with you Master.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
255,PADME,Suddenly I'm afraid...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
256,ANAKIN,I'm kinda scared too. This is my first assignment on my own.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,12
257,PADME,There's nothing to worry about... we have Artoo with us.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,10
258,OBI-WAN,I hope he doesn't try anything foolish.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
259,CAPTAIN TYPHO,I'd be more concerned about her doing something than him.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
260,PK-4,Place the subject for analysis on the sensot tray please.,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,10
261,OBI-WAN,It's a toxic dart. I need to know where it came from and who made it.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
262,PK-4,One moment please.,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,3
263,PK-4, As you can see on your screen subject weapon does not exist in any known culture. Markings cannot be identified. Probablt self-made by a warrior not associated with any known society.,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,31
264,OBI-WAN,Excuse me? Could you try again please?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
265,PK-4,Master Jedi our records are very thorough. they cover eight percent of the galaxy. If I can't tell you where it came from nobody can.,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,25
266,OBI-WAN,Thanks for your assistance! You may not be able to figure this out but I think I know someone who might.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
267,SERVER,Keep moving! Keep moving!,True,Attack of the Clones,,4
268,FOOD SERVER, Hey! No Droids!,True,Attack of the Clones,,3
269,ANAKIN,No no Mom no...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
270,ANAKIN, What?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
271,PADME,You seemed to be having a nightmare.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
272,PADME, Are you hungry?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
273,ANAKIN,Thank you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
274,PADME,We went into lightspeed a while ago.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
275,ANAKIN,I look forward to seeing Naboo again. I've thought about it every day since I left. It's by far the most beautiful place I've ever seen...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,26
276,PADME,You were just a little boy then. It may not be as you remember it; time changes your perception.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,19
277,ANAKIN,I think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
278,PADME,It must be difficult having sworn your life to the Jedi... not being able to visit the places you like... or do the things you like...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,26
279,ANAKIN,Or be with the people I love.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
280,PADME,Are you allowed to love? I thought that was forbidden for a Jedi.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,13
281,ANAKIN,Attachment is forbidden. Possession is forbidden. Compassion which I would define as unconditional love is central to a Jedi's life so you might say we're encouraged to love.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,28
282,PADME,You have changed so much,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
283,ANAKIN,You haven't changed a bit. You're exactly the way I remember you in my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has changed much either.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
284,PADME,It hasn't...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,2
285,ANAKIN,I can't wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills. Whenever I try to visualise the Force those hills are what I see.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
286,ANAKIN, I love Naboo.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
287,PADME, Were you dreaming about you mother earlier weren't you?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,9
288,ANAKIN,Yes... I left Tatooine so long ago my memory of her is fading. I don't want to lose it. Recently I've been seeing her in my dreams... vivid dreams... scary dreams. I worry about her.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,35
289,HERMIONE BAGWA,Can I help ya?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
290,OBI-WAN,I'm looking for Dexter.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
291,HERMIONE BAGWA,Waddya want him for?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
292,OBI-WAN,He's not in trouble. It's personal.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
293,HERMIONE BAGWA,Someone to see ya honey  A Jedi by the looks of him.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,12
294,DEXTER JETTSTER,Obi-Wan!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
295,OBI-WAN,Hey Dex.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
296,DEXTER JETTSTER,Take a seat! Be right with ya!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
297,HERMIONE BAGWA,You want a cup of ardees?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
298,OBI-WAN,Thank you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
299,DEXTER JETTSTER,Hey ol' buddy!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
300,OBI-WAN,Hey Dex.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
301,DEXTER JETTSTER,So my friend. What can I do for ya?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9
302,OBI-WAN,You can tell me what this is.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
303,DEXTER JETTSTER,Well whattaya know...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
304,DEXTER JETTSTER, I ain't seen one of these since I was prospecting on Subterrel beyond the Outer Rim!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
305,OBI-WAN,Do you know where it came from?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
306,DEXTER JETTSTER,This baby belongs to them cloners. What you got here is a Kamino Kyberdart.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
307,OBI-WAN,Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why it didn't show up in any analysis archive.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,13
308,DEXTER JETTSTER,It's these funny little cuts on the side give it away... Those analysis droids you've got over there only focus on symbols you know. I should think you Jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,40
309,OBI-WAN,Well Dex if droids could think we wouldn't be here would we?  Kamino... doesn't sound familiar. Is it part of the Republic?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,22
310,DEXTER JETTSTER,No it's beyond the Outer Rim. I'd say about twelve parsecs outside the Rishi Maze toward the south. It should be easy to find even for those droids in your archive to find. Those Kaminoans keep to themselves. They're cloners. Damned good ones too.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,44
311,OBI-WAN,Cloners? Are they friendly?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
312,DEXTER JETTSTER,It depends.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
313,OBI-WAN,On what Dex?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
314,DEXTER JETTSTER,On how good your manners are... and how big your pocketbook is...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,12
315,ANAKIN,If I grew up here I don't think I'd ever leave.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
316,PADME, I doubt that.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
317,ANAKIN,No really. When I started my training I was very homesick and very lonely. This city and my Mom were the only pleasant things I had to think about... The problem was the more I thought about my Mom the worse I felt. But I would feel better if I thought about the palace - the way it shimmers in the sunlight - the way the air always smells of flowers...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,71
318,PADME,...and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls. The first time I saw the Capital I was very young... I'd never seen a waterfall before. I though they were so beautiful... I never dreamed one day I'd live in the palace.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,41
319,ANAKIN,Well tell me did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
320,PADME," No! That was the last thing I thought of. My dream was to help in the ""Refugee Relief Movement."" I never thought of running for elected office. But the more history I studied the more I realised how much good politicians could do. So when I was eight I joined the ""Apprentice Legislators"" then later on became a Senatorial advisor with such a passion that before I knew it I was elected Queen. Partly because I scored so high on my education certificate but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible. I wasn't the youngest Queen ever elected but now that I think back on it I'm not sure I was old enough. I'm not sure I was ready.",True,Attack of the Clones,Female,124
321,ANAKIN,The people you served thought you did a good job. I heard they tried to amend the Constitution so you could stay in office.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,24
322,PADME,Popular rule is not democracy Annie. It gives the people what they want not what they need. And truthfully I was relieved when my two terms were up. So were my parents. They worried About me during the blockade and couldn't wait for it all to be over. Actually I was hoping to have a family by now... My sisters have the most amazing wonderful kids... but when the Queen asked me to serve as Senator I couldn't refuse her.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,80
323,ANAKIN,I agree! I think the Republic needs you... I'm glad you chose to serve. I feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,32
324,PADME,I think so too.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
325,QUEEN JAMILLIA,We've been worried about you.  I'm so glad you're safe Padmé.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,11
326,PADME,Thank you Your Highness. I only Wish I could have served you better by staying on Coruscant for the vote.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,20
327,SIO BIBBLE,Given the circumstances Senator you know it was the only decision Her Highness could have made.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
328,QUEEN JAMILLIA,How many systems have joined Count Dooku and the separatists?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,10
329,PADME,About two hundred. And more are leaving the Republic every day. If the Senate votes to create an army I'm sure it's going to push us into a civil war.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,30
330,SIO BIBBLE,It's unthinkable! There hasn't been a full-scale war since the formation of the Republic!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
331,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Do you see any way through negotiations to bring the separatists back into the Republic?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,15
332,PADME,Not if they feel threatened. The separatists don't have an army but if they are provoked they will move to defend themselves. I'm sure of that. And with no time or money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the Commerce Guilds or the Trade Federation for help.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,52
333,QUEEN JAMILLIA,The armies of commerce! Why has Nothing been done in the Senate to restrain them?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,15
334,PADME,I'm afraid that despite the Chancellor's best efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even Senators on the payrolls of the Guilds.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,23
335,SIO BIBBLE,It's outrageous! After all of those hearings and the four trials in the Supreme Court Nute Gunray is still the Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Do those money mongers control everything?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,31
336,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Remember Counsellor the courts were able to reduce the Federation's armies. That's a move in the right direction.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,18
337,PADME,There are rumours Your Highness that the Federation Army was not reduced as they were ordered.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,16
338,ANAKIN,The Jedi have not been allowed to investigate. It would be to be too dangerous for the economy we were told.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
339,QUEEN JAMILLIA,We must keep our faith in the Republic. The day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,22
340,PADME,Let's pray that day never comes.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
341,QUEEN JAMILLIA,In the meantime we must consider your own safety.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,9
342,SIO BIBBLE, What is your suggestion Master Jedi?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
343,PADME,Anakin's not a Jedi yet Counsellor. He's still a Padawan learner. I was thinking...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14
344,ANAKIN, Hey hold on a minute!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
345,PADME,Excuse me! I was thinking I would stay in the Lake Country. There are some places up there that are very isolated.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,22
346,ANAKIN,Excuse me?! I am in charge of security here M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
347,PADME,Annie my life is at risk and this is my home. I know it very well... that is why we're here. I think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,38
348,ANAKIN, Sorry M'Lady.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
349,SIO BIBBLE, She is right. The Lake Country is the most remote part of Naboo. Not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,24
350,QUEEN JAMILLIA,Perfect. It's settled then.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
351,QUEEN JAMILLIA, Padmé I had an audience with your father yesterday. I told him what was happening. He hopes you will visit your mother before you leave... your family's very worried about you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,31
352,JOCASTA NU,Did you call for assistance?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
353,OBI-WAN, Yes... yes I did...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
354,JOCASTA NU,He has a powerful face doesn't he? He was one of the most brilliant Jedi I have had the privilege of knowing.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,22
355,OBI-WAN,I never understood why he quit. Only twenty Jedi have ever left the Order.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
356,JOCASTA NU, The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku was the most recent and the most painful. No one likes to talk about it. His leaving was a great loss to the Order.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,30
357,OBI-WAN,What happened?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
358,JOCASTA NU,Well one might say he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the Council... much like your old Master Qui-Gon Jinn.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,25
359,OBI-WAN, Really?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
360,JOCASTA NU,Oh yes. They were alike in many ways. Very individual thinkers... idealists...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,12
361,JOCASTA NU,(continuing He was always striving to become a more powerful Jedi. He wanted to be the best. With a lightsaber in the old style of fencing he had no match. His knowledge of the Force was... unique. In the end I think he left because he lost faith in the Republic. He believed that politics were corrupt and he felt the Jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians. He always had very high expectations of government. He disappeared for nine or ten years then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,96
362,OBI-WAN,Interesting... I'm still not sure I understand.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
363,JOCASTA NU,Well I'm sure you didn't call me over here for a history lesson. Are you having a problem Master Kenobi?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,20
364,OBI-WAN,Yes I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
365,JOCASTA NU,Kamino? It's not a system I'M familiar with... Let me see...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,11
366,JOCASTA NU, Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8
367,OBI-WAN, According to my information it should be in this quadrant somewhere... just south of the Rishi Maze.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
368,JOCASTA NU,No co-ordinates? It sounds like the kind of directions you'd get from a street tout... some old miner or Furbog trader.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,21
369,OBI-WAN,All three actually.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
370,JOCASTA NU,Are you sure it exists?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
371,OBI-WAN,Absolutely.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
372,JOCASTA NU,Let me do a gravitational scan.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
373,JOCASTA NU,There are some inconsistencies here. Maybe the planet you're looking for was destroyed.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,13
374,OBI-WAN,Wouldn't that be on record?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
375,JOCASTA NU,It ought to be. Unless it was very recent.  I hate to say it but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,25
376,OBI-WAN,That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
377,JOCASTA NU,The archives are comprehensive and totally secure my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records it does not exist!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,32
378,PADME,There's my house!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
379,PADME, What? Don't say you're shy!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
380,ANAKIN, No but I...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
381,RYOO & POOJA,Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4

396,SOLA,Well this is exciting! Do you know Anakin you're the first boyfriend my sister's ever brought home?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,17
397,PADME, Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend! He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate to protect me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,15
398,JOVAL,A bodyguard?! Oh Padme! They didn't tell us it was that serious!,True,Attack of the Clones,,12
399,PADME,It's not Mom I promise.  Anyway Anakin's a friend. I've known him for years. Remember that little boy who was with the Jedi during the blockade crisis?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,27
400,PADME, He grew up.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
401,JOBAL,Honey when are you going to settle down? Haven't you had enough of that life? I certainly have!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,18
402,PADME,Mom I'm not in any danger.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
403,RUWEE, Is she?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
404,ANAKIN,...Yes... I'm afraid she is.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
405,PADME, But not much.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
406,RUWEE,Sometimes I wish I'd traveled more... but I must say I'm happy here.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,13
407,ANAKIN,Padme tells me you teach at the university?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
408,RUWEE, Yes and before that I was a builder. I also worked for the Refugee Relief Movement when I was very young.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
409,SOLA,Why haven't you told us about him?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
410,PADME,What's there to talk about?  He's just a boy.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,9
411,SOLA,A boy? Have you seen the way he looks at you?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,11
412,PADME,Sola - stop it!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
413,SOLA,It's obvious he has feelings for you. Are you saying little baby sister that you haven't noticed?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,17
414,PADME,I'm not your baby sister Sola. Anakin and I are friends... our relationship is strictly professional.  Mom would you tell her to stop it?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,24
415,SOLA, Well maybe you haven't noticed the way he looks at you. I think you're afraid to.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,16
416,PADME,Cut it out.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
417,JOBAL,Sola's just concerned... we all are.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
418,PADME,Oh Mom you're impossible. What I'm doing is important.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,9

420,RUWEE,Now tell me son. How serious is this thing? How much danger is my daughter really in?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
421,ANAKIN,There have been two attempts on her life. Chances are there'll be more. My Master is tracking down the assassins. I'm sure he'll find out who they are. This situation won't last long.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,33
422,RUWEE,I don't want anything to happen to her.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
423,ANAKIN,I don't either.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
424,PADME,Don't worry this won't take long.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
425,ANAKIN,I just want to get there before dark.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
426,ANAKIN, You still live at home.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
427,PADME,I move around so much I've never had a place of my own. Official residences have no warmth. I feel good here. I feel at home.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,26
428,ANAKIN,I never had a real home. Home was always where my Mom was.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,13
429,ANAKIN, Is this you?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
430,PADME,That was when I went with the Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran. Their sun was imploding and the planet was dying. I was helping to relocate the children. See that little one I'm holding? His name was N'a-kee-tula which means sweethear. He was so full of  life. All those kids were. I did everything I could to save him but he died... they all did. They were never able to adapt... to live off their native planet.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,76
431,PADME, My first day as an Apprentice Legislator. Notice the difference?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,10
432,YODA,Don't think... feel... be as one with the Force. Help you it will.  Younglings - enough! A visitor we have. Welcome him.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,22
433,YODA, Master Obi-Wan Kenobi meet the mighty Bear Clan.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
434,CHILDREN,Welcome Master Obi-Wan!,True,Attack of the Clones,,3
435,OBI-WAN,I am sorry to disturb you Master.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
436,YODA,What help to you can I be?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
437,OBI-WAN,Im looking for a planet described to me by an old friend. I trust him. But the system doesnt show up on the archive maps.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,25
438,YODA,An interesting puzzle. Gather round the map reader younglings. Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet. Find it we will try...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,20
439,OBI-WAN,This is where it ought to be... but it isnt. Gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot. There should be a star here... but there isnt.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,32
440,YODA,Most interesting. Gravitys silhouette remains but the star and all its planets have disappeared. How can this be?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,18
441,JEDI CHILD JACK,Because someone erased it from the archive memory.,True,Attack of the Clones,,8
442,CHILDREN,Thats right! Yes! Thats what happened! Someone erased it!,True,Attack of the Clones,,9
443,JEDI CHILD MAY,If the planet blew up the gravity would go away.,True,Attack of the Clones,,10
444,YODA,Truly wonderful the mind of a child is. Uncluttered. To the centre of the pull of gravity go and find your planet you will.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,24
445,OBI-WAN,But Master Yoda who could have erased information from the archives? Thats impossible isnt it?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,15
446,YODA, Much harder to answer that question is.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
447,PADME,When I was in Level Three we used to come here for school retreat. See that island? We used to swim there every day. I love the water.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,28
448,ANAKIN,I do too. I guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
449,PADME,...We used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us... and try to guess the names of the birds singing.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,23
450,ANAKIN,I dont like sand. Its coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. Not like here. Here everythings soft... and smooth...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,22
451,PADME,There was a very old man who lived on the island. He used to make glass out of sand - and vases and necklaces out of the glass. They were magical.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,31
452,ANAKIN, Everything here is magical.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
453,PADME,You could look into the glass and see the water. The way it ripples and moves. It looked so real... but it wasnt.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,23
454,ANAKIN,Sometimes when you believe something to be real it becomes real. Real enough anyway...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
455,PADME,I used to think if you looked too deeply into glass you would lose yourself.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,15
456,ANAKIN,I think it's true...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
457,PADME,I shouldn't have done that.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
458,ANAKIN,I'm sorry. When I'm around you my mind is no longer my own.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,13
459,PADME,It's the situation... the stress...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
460,ANAKIN,...the view.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
461,MACE WINDU ,Be wary this disturbance in the Force is growing stronger.,True,Attack of the Clones,,10
462,OBI-WAN,I am concerned for my Padawan. He is not ready to be on his own.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,15
463,YODA,The Council is confident in this decision Obi-Wan.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
464,MACE WINDU,He has exceptional skills. The Council is confident in its decision Obi-Wan. If the prophecy is true he weill be the one to bring balance to the Force.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,28
465,OBI-WAN,But he still has much to learn. And his abilities have made him... well... arrogant. I realise now what you and Master Yoda knew from the beginning... the boy was too old to start the training and...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,37
466,MACE WINDU ,There's something else?,True,Attack of the Clones,,3
467,OBI-WAN,Master he should not have been given this assignment. I'm afraid Anakin won't be able to protect the Senator. ,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,19
468,MACE WINDU ,Why?,True,Attack of the Clones,,1
469,OBI-WAN,He has a... an emotional connection with her. It's been there since he was boy. Now he's confused... distracted.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,19
470,MACE WINDU ,Obi-Wan you must have faith that he will take the right path.,True,Attack of the Clones,,12
471,OBI-WAN,Has Master Yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,15
472,MACE WINDU ,Probing the Dark Side is a dangerous process. He could be in seclusion for days... May the force be with you.,True,Attack of the Clones,,21
473,PADME,You did that?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
474,ANAKIN,What?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
475,PADME,That! Now stop it!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
476,PADME, Anakin!!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,1
477,ANAKIN,I'm not really supposed to do that... for fun I mean. If Master Obi-Wan were here he'd be very grumpy.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,20
478,ANAKIN,May I tell you something?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
479,PADME,I don't know.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
480,ANAKIN,Then how can I tell you?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
481,PADME,Maybe you should use your Jedi intuition.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
482,ANAKIN,It doesn't work around you. My mind is always a muddle... I can only think of you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
483,PADME,Anakin don't...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,2
484,ANAKIN,From the moment I met you all those years ago a day hasn't gone by when I haven't thought of you. And now that I'm close to you again I'm in agony. The closer I get to you the worse it gets. The thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over - my mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I can't breathe. I'm haunted by the kiss you should never have given me. My heart is beating hoping that kiss will not become a scar. You are in my very soul tormenting me. What can I do? I will do anything you ask...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,106
485,ANAKIN, If you are suffering as much as I am tell me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
486,PADME,...I can't. We can't. It's just not possible.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8
487,ANAKIN,Anything's possible. Padme please listen...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
488,PADME,You listen. We live in a real world. Come back to it. You're studying to become a Jedi Knight. I'm a Senator. If you follow your thoughts through to conclusion they will take us to a place we cannot go... regardless of the way we feel about each other.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,49
489,ANAKIN,Then you do feel something! There's an extraordinary connection between us. You can't deny that.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,15
490,PADME,Annie it doesn't make any difference. Jedi aren't allowed to marry. You swore an oath remember? You'd be expelled from the Order. I will not let you give up your responsibilities... your future for me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,35
491,ANAKIN,I was destined to be a Jedi. I don't think I could be anything else. But you are asking me to be rational. That is something I know I cannot do. I wish I could wish my feelings away... but I can't.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,42
492,PADME,I am not going to give into this. I'm not going to throw my life away. I have more important things to do than fall in love.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,27
493,ANAKIN,It wouldn't have to be that way... we could keep it a secret.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,13
494,PADME,Then we'd be living a lie - one we couldn't keep even if we wanted to. Mt sister saw it. So did my mother. I couldn't do that. Could you Anakin? Could you live like that?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,36
495,ANAKIN,...No you're right. It would destroy us.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
496,TAUN WE,Welcome to Tipoca City Master Jedi.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
497,TAUN WE,Everything is ready. The Prime Minister expects you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8
498,OBI-WAN, I'm expected?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
499,TAUN WE,Of course! He is anxious to see you. After all these years we were beginning to think you weren't coming. Now please this way!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,24
500,TAUN WE,May I present Lama Su Prime Minister of Kamino... and this is Master Jedi...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14
501,OBI-WAN,Obi-Wan Kenobi.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
502,LAMA SU,Please...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
503,LAMA SU,I trust you are going to enjoy your stay. We are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
504,OBI-WAN,You make me feel most welcome.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
505,LAMA SU,And now to business. You will be delighted to hear we are on schedule. Two hundred thousand units are ready with another million well on the way.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
506,OBI-WAN, That is... good news.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
507,LAMA SU,Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full. He is well I hope?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,25
508,OBI-WAN,I'm sorry Master - ?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
509,LAMA SU,Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still a leading member of the Jedi Council is he not?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,15
510,OBI-WAN,Oh yes. Sido-Dyas.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
511,LAMA SU, You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
512,OBI-WAN,That's why I'm here.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
513,PADME,I don't know...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
514,ANAKIN,Sure you do... you just don't want to tell me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
515,PADME,Are you going to use one of your Jedi mind tricks on me?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,13
516,ANAKIN,They only work on the weak-minded. You are anything but weak-minded.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
517,PADME,All right... his name was Palo. I was twelve. We were both in the Legislative Youth Program. He was a few years older then I... very cute... dark curly hair... dreamy eyes.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,32
518,ANAKIN,All right I get the picture... whatever happened to him?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
519,PADME,I went on to become a Queen. He went on to become an artist.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14
520,ANAKIN,Maybe he was the smart one.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
521,PADME,You really don't like politicians do you?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
522,ANAKIN,I like two or three but I'm not really sure about one of them.  I don't think the system works.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,20
523,PADME,How would you have it work?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,6
524,ANAKIN,We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems agree what's in the best interests of all the people and then do it.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
525,PADME,That is exactly what we do. The trouble is that people don't wlways agree. In fact they hardly ever do.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,20
526,ANAKIN,Then they should be made to.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
527,PADME,By whom? Who's going to make them?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
528,ANAKIN,I don't know. Someone.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
529,PADME,You?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,1
530,ANAKIN,Of course not me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
531,PADME,But someone.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,2
532,ANAKIN,Someone wise.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
533,PADME,That sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,10
534,ANAKIN,Well if it works...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
535,PADME,You're making fun of me.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,5
536,ANAKIN,  On no I'd be much too frightened to tease a Senator.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
537,PADME,You're so bad!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
538,ANAKIN,You're always so serious. Always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
539,LAMA SU, Magnificent aren't they?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
540,LAMA SU,We modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host. As a result they are totally obedient taking any order without question.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,26
541,OBI-WAN,Who was the original host?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
542,LAMA SU,A bounty hunter called Jango Fett. We felt a Jedi would be the perfect choice but Sido-Dyas hand- picked Jango Fett himself.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,22
543,OBI-WAN,Where is this bounty hunter now?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
544,LAMA SU,Oh we keep him here. After a few hundred thousand clones the genetic pattern starts to fade so we take a fresh supply. He lives here but he's free to come and go as he pleases.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,36
545,LAMA SU,Apart from his pay which is considerable Fett demanded only one thing - an unaltered clone for himself. Curious isn't it?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
546,OBI-WAN,Unaltered?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,1
547,LAMA SU,Pure genetic replication. No tampering with the structure to make it more docile... and no growth acceleration...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
548,OBI-WAN,I would like to meet this Jango Fett.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
549,TAUN WE,I would be most happy to arrange it for you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,10
550,OBI-WAN,You mentioned growth acceleration...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
551,LAMA SU,Oh yes it's essential. Otherwise a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow. Now we can do it in half the time. Those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago when Sido-dyas first placed the order and they're already mature...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,46
552,OBI-WAN,And these?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
553,LAMA SU,About five years ago.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
554,LAMA SU,They're immensely superior to droids capable of independent thought and action.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
555,OBI-WAN,Very impressive.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
556,LAMA SU,I'd hoped you would be pleased. ,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
557,OBI-WAN, Tell me prime minister when my Master Sido-dyas first contacted you did he say the order was for... himself... or?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,20

559,OBI-WAN, The Repubic?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
560,LAMA SU,We are also very much agasint this Count Dooku and his seccessionist movement. We are proud to be of help to the Republic.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
561,TAUN WE,I have arranged for you to meet Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep well.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14

564,OBI-WAN (V.O.),...I've never heard of a Jedi called Sido-Dyas have you Master?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
565,MACE WINDU ,No. Whoever placed that order was not a Jedi I can assure you.,True,Attack of the Clones,,13
566,OBI-WAN (V.O.),I have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin we're looking for.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,15

570,YODA,Inform the chancellor of this we must.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,7
571,MACE WINDU,Who do you think this impostor Sido-Dyas could be?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9

579,ANAKIN,I saw my mother. I saw her as clearly as I see you now. She's suffering Padme. She is in pain...They're killing her!  I know I'm disobeying my mandate to protect you Senator. I know I will be punished and possibly thrown out of the Jedi Order but I must go. I have to help her! I'm sorry Padme. I don't have a choice.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,64
580,PADME,Annie I told you I wouldn't let you give up your future for me. I'll go with you. That way you can continue to protect me and you won't be disobeying your mandate.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,33
581,ANAKIN,What about Master Obi-wan?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
582,PADME,I guess we won't tell him will we?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8

652,CLIEGG, Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife... Come on inside. We have a lot to talk about.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
653,CLIEGG (O.S.),It was just before dawn. They came out of nowhere. A hunting party of Tusekn Raiders.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,16
654,CLIEGG,Your mother had gone out early like she always did to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. From the tracks she was about halfway when they took her. Those Tuskens walk like men but they're vicious mindless monsters. Thirty of us went out after her. Four of us came back. Three more are still out there looking. I'd be with them only... I just couldn't ride any more... until I heal.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,72
655,CLIEGG, This isn't the way I wanted to meet you son. This isn't how your mother and I planned it. I don't want to give up on her but she's been gone a month. There's little hope she's lasted this long.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,40
656,OWEN,Where are you going?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4

681,PADME,Being like what?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
682,THREEPIO,Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see when Master Annie made me he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,44
683,PADME,I guess I wouldn't like it at all.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8
684,THREEPIO,Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,10
685,PADME,Maybe we can do something about it.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,7
686,THREEPIO,I don't think so. Only Master Annie...,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,7
687,PADME,Why not? They seem to have a box of old coverings here.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,12

699,OBI-WAN,...Starships from the Trade Federation and the Commerce Guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on Geonosis.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,20
700,BAIL ORGANA,That's outrageous! The treaty forbids the Trade Federation from building up an army. What are they doing?!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
701,OBI-WAN,The droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity. I am going to go down and investigate. I will bring Jango Fett back home for interrogation.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
702,PALPATINE,Those Geonosian foundries are part of the Techno Union. We will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
703,OBI-WAN,One more thing. Jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that might be?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,19
704,YODA,With the forename Darth a Sith he must be.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9
705,MACE WINDU ,Our missing apprentice. They are playing their hand at last.,True,Attack of the Clones,,10
706,OBI-WAN,Do you believe he could be the mysterious Sido-Dyas who made the deal for the clone army?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
707,YODA,Perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle there are.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
708,MACE WINDU ,Be careful Obi-Wan. This investigation is becoming less than routine. Do you need help?,True,Attack of the Clones,,14
709,OBI-WAN,Let me see if I can figure out what's going on first.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,12
710,BAIL ORGANA,The Commerce Guilds are preparing for war... there can be no doubt of that.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
711,PALPATINE,Count Dooku must have made a treaty with them.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,9
712,MACE WINDU ,We must stop them soon before they're fully ready.,True,Attack of the Clones,,9
713,SENATOR ASK AAK,The debate is over we need that clone army now!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
714,BAIL ORGANA,Unfortunately the debate is not over. The Senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
715,MAS AMEDDA,This is a crisis! If the Senate votes the Chancellor emergency powers he could approve the use of the army in a minute.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
716,PALPATINE,Please please I don't wish to have emergency powers. That's too extreme a solution. It's akin to a dictatorship. We must rely on the Jedi. Master Yoda how many are available to go to Geonosis?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,35
717,YODA,Two Hundred... less or more.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
718,BAIL ORGANA,With all due respect for the Jedi Order two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,21
719,MACE WINDU ,Patience. We should wait for Obi- Wan to report back. We don't know that Count Dooku has made a treaty with the Corporate Alliance it's speculation.,True,Attack of the Clones,,26
720,SENATOR ASK AAK,But we must prepare for the worst. I'm going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the Chancellor at the next session. We must not wait!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
721,PALPATINE,Out of the question Senator! You and I are too closely aligned. The issue will become partisan and debates will begin. The proposal must come from a neutral source.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,29
722,MAS AMEDDA,If only Senator Amidala were here.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,6
723,JAR JAR,Supreme Chancellor... my august colleagues I would be proud to propose the motion in question. This is a grave situation and I'm sure Senator Amidala and the Queen of Naboo would agree.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,32
724,SENATOR ASK AAK,Thank you Representative Binks.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4

736,ANAKIN,I'm going after him!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
737,PADME,I thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to Coruscant.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,14
738,ANAKIN,Yeah you're right you're right.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
739,MACE WINDU ,We will deal with Count Dooku. The most important thing for you Anakin is to stay where you are. Protect the Senator at all costs. That is your priority.,True,Attack of the Clones,,29
740,ANAKIN,Understood Master.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
741,PADME,They'll never get there in time to save him. They have to come half way across the galaxy. Look Geonosis is less than a parsec away.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,26
742,ANAKIN,If he's still alive.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4
743,PADME,Annie are you just going to sit here and let him die?? He's your friend... your mentor...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,17
744,ANAKIN,...He's like my father but you heard Master Windu. He gave me strict orders to stay here.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
745,PADME,He gave you strict orders to protect me...,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,8
746,PADME, ...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan. So if you plan to protect me you will have to come along.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,19
747,MACE WINDU ,The longer we wait the stronger Dooku's armies become. We cannot wait for the Senate to make up its mind about granting the Chancellor emergency powers in order to be able to use that clone army... We have the authority to go now. We must go now.,True,Attack of the Clones,,47
748,YODA,Agreed Master Windu. Two hundred Jedi send. Enough let's hope they are.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,12
749,MAS AMEDDA,Order! Order!!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,2
750,PALPATINE,In the regrettable absence of Senator Amidala the chair recognises Senior Representative of Naboo Jar Jar Binks.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
751,JAR JAR,Senators dellow felagates...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
752,MAS AMEDDA,Order! The Senate will accord the Representative the courtesy of a hearing!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,12
753,JAR JAR,In response to the direct threat to the Republic from the Confederacy of Independent Systems I propose that the Senate gives immediate emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,28
754,JAR JAR, Who can deny these are exceptional times? Exceptional times demand exceptional measures! Exceptional measures demand exceptional men!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
755,ORN FREE TAA,We won't support a dictator.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
756,JAR JAR,That is the sentiment every one of us agrees with! And when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again the power we now give to the Supreme Chancellor will be gladly and swiftly returned. Out ancient liberties will be restored to us burnished even more brightly than before!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,57
757,PALPATINE,It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling. I love democracy... I love the Republic. The fact that this crisis is demanding I be given absolute power to tule over you is evident. But I am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process. The power you give me I will lay down when this crisis has abated I promise you. And all I ask in return is when my current term of office is over you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,96
758,MAS AMEDDA,We shall proceed to the vote. All those in favor of granting emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor signal ate at this time... those opposed?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,25
759,ANAKIN,Hey where are you going?,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,5
760,PADME,To find Obi-Wan.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
761,ANAKIN,No! You're not!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,3
762,PADME,Let go of me!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
763,ANAKIN,I'm not letting you go out there. It's too dangerous.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,10
764,PADME,What?!?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,1
765,ANAKIN,It's my job to protect you. I said it's too dangerous. You're not going and that's final!,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,17
766,PADME,Don't you give me orders Annie! I'm a Senator of the Galactic Republic. You have no authority to contain me restrain me or direct me! You remember your place young man.  Now you can come along and protect me or stay here. It's up to you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,46
767,THREEPIO,Yes it is Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them I doubt if I ever shall.,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,34
768,PADME, It's empty!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,2
769,PADME,Wait!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,1
770,COUNT DOOKU,Senator Amidala I've heard so much about you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,8
771,PADME,Count Dooku I assume.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
772,COUNT DOOKU,I'm delighted to meet you at last. We have a great deal to discuss Senator. I hope you can keep your young Jedi under control.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,25
773,PADME,Don't worry he's housebroken.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,4
774,PADME,You are holding a Jedi Knight Obi- Wan Kenobi. I am formally requesting you turn him over to me now.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,20
775,COUNT DOOKU,He has been convicted of espionage Senator and will be executed. In just a few hours I believe.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,18
776,PADME,He is an officer of the Republic. You can't do that.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,11
777,COUNT DOOKU,We don't recognise the Republic here Senator. But if Naboo were to join our Alliance I could easily hear your plea for clemency.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,23
778,PADME,And if I don't join your rebellion I assume this Jedi with me will also die?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,16
779,COUNT DOOKU,I don't wish to make you to join our cause against your will Senator but you are a rational honest representative of your people and I assume you want to do what's in their best interest. Aren't you fed up with the corruption the bureaucrats the hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't you? Be honest Senator.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,55
780,PADME,The ideals are still alive Count even if the institution is failing.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,12
781,COUNT DOOKU,You believe in the same ideals we believe in! The same ideals we are striving to make prominent.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,18
782,PADME,If what you say is true you should stay in the Republic and help Chancellor Palpatine put things right.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,19
783,COUNT DOOKU,The Chancellor means well M'Lady but he is incompetent. He has promised to cut the bureaucracy but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever no? Senator the Republic cannot be fixed. It is time to start over. The democratic process in the Republic is a sham a shell game played on the voters. It will not be long before the cult of greed called the Republic will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,74
784,PADME,I cannot believe that. I will not forsake all I have honoured and worked for and betray the Republic. I know of your treaties with the Trade Federation the Commerce Guilds and the others Count. What is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business... it's business becoming government!,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,53
785,COUNT DOOKU,Are you willing to betray your Jedi friends? Without your co-operation I can do nothing to stop their execution.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,19
786,PADME,What is to happen to me? Am I to be executed also?,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,12
787,COUNT DOOKU,I wouldn't think of such an offence. But there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise M'lady. It has nothing to do with politics I'm afraid. It's purely personal and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated. I'm sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions. I'm sorry but if you are not going to co-operate I must turn you over to the Geonosians for justice. I've done all I can for you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,83
788,JANGO FETT,I'll take that weapon.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,4

800,PADME,I love you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,3
801,ANAKIN,You love me?! I thought we decided not to fall in love. That we would be forced to live a lie. That it would destroy our lives...,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,27
802,PADME,I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway. My love for you is a puzzle Annie for which I have no answers. I can't control it... and now I don't care. I truly deeply love you and before we die I want you to know.,True,Attack of the Clones,Female,47
803,ANAKIN,I have no desire to be cured of this love either. Long or short I vow to spend the rest of my life with you.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,25
804,OBI-WAN,I was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11

817,NUTE GUNRAY,This isn't how it's supposed to be! Jango finish her off.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,11
818,COUNT DOOKU, Patiece Viceroy... she will die. Maybe this is the way it's supposed to end.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,14
819,THREEPIO,Yes it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them?,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,15
820,THREEPIO, Danger? Oh no I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying Artoo.,True,Attack of the Clones,Droid,24
821,COUNT DOOKU,Master Windu how pleasant of you to join us. You're just in time for the moment of truth. I would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.,True,Attack of the Clones,Male,33
