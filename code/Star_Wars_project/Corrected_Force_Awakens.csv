1,17,Lor San Tekka,This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far and seen too much to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi there can be no balance in the Force.
3,19,Poe Dameron ,Well because of you now we have a chance. The General's been after this for a long time.
5,21,Lor San Tekka,Oh the General?  To me she is royalty.
7,23,Poe Dameron ,Well she certainly is that. We got company. 
9,25,Lor San Tekka,You have to hide. You have to leave. Go.
11,27,Poe Dameron ,Come on BB-8 hurry!
13,29,Storm Trooper 6,Blast that X-Wing! Over there! Over there!
15,31,Poe Dameron ,I see them. You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me?  I'll come back for you. It will be all right.
17,33,Storm Trooper 6,Keep moving!
19,35,Storm Trooper 5,Stay here.
21,37,Kylo Ren,Look how old you've become.
23,39,Lor San Tekka,Something far worse has happened to you.
25,41,Kylo Ren,You know what I've come for.
27,43,Lor San Tekka,I know where you come from. Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.
29,45,Kylo Ren,The map to Skywalker. We know you found it. And now you're going to give it to the First Order.
31,47,Lor San Tekka,The First Order rose from the dark side. You did not.
33,49,Kylo Ren,I'll show you the dark side.
35,51,Lor San Tekka,You may try. But you cannot deny the truth that is your family.
37,53,Kylo Ren,You're so right.
39,55,Poe Dameron ,So who talks first? You talk first? I talk first?
41,57,Kylo Ren,The old man gave it to you.
43,59,Poe Dameron ,It's just very hard to understand you with all the...
45,61,Kylo Ren,Search him.
47,63,Poe Dameron ,...apparatus.
49,65,Storm Trooper,Nothing sir.
51,67,Kylo Ren,Put him on board.
53,69,Phasma,Sir the villagers?
55,71,Kylo Ren,Kill them all.
57,73,Phasma,On my command.  Fire.
59,75,Villager,Please no!
61,77,Storm Trooper,Nothing here. Go ahead!
63,85,Poe Dameron ,All right. All right!
65,87,Phasma,FN-2187. Submit your blaster for inspection.
67,89,Finn (FN-2187),Yes Captain.
69,91,Phasma,And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?
71,93,Finn (FN-2187),I'm sorry Captain.
73,95,Phasma,Report to my division at once.
75,101,Unkar,What you brought me today is worth... hmm... one quarter portion.
77,103,Rey,Shh. That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. Where do you come from? Classified really? Me too. Big secret. Niima Outpost is that way. Stay off Kelvin Ridge. Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north. You'll drown in the sand. Don't follow me. Town is that way. No! In the morning you go. You're welcome.
79,111,Kylo Ren,I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable?
81,113,Poe Dameron ,Not really.
83,115,Kylo Ren,I'm impressed. No one has been able to get out of you... what you did with the map.
85,117,Poe Dameron ,You might want to rethink your technique.
87,119,Kylo Ren,Where is it?
89,121,Poe Dameron ,The Resistance... will not be intimidated by you.
91,123,Kylo Ren,Where... is it? It's in a droid. A BB unit.
93,125,General Hux,Well then if it's on Jakku we'll soon have it.
95,127,Kylo Ren,I leave that to you.
97,133,Rey,Don't give up hope. He still might show up. Whoever it is you're waiting for. Classified. I know all about waiting. For my family. They'll be back. One day. Come on.
99,135,Unkar,These five pieces are worth... Let me see here... hmm... one half portion.
101,137,Rey,Last week they were a half portion each.
103,139,Unkar,What about the droid?
105,141,Rey,What about him?
107,143,Unkar,I'll pay for him. Sixty portions.
109,145,Rey,Actually... The droid's not for sale. Come on.
111,147,Unkar,Follow the girl and get that droid.
113,153,Finn (FN-2187),Ren wants the prisoner. Turn here. Listen carefully. If you do exactly as I say I can get you out of here.
115,155,Poe Dameron ,What?
117,157,Finn (FN-2187),This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter?
119,159,Poe Dameron ,You're with the Resistance?
121,161,Finn (FN-2187),What? No no no. I'm breaking you out. Can you fly a TIE fighter?
123,163,Poe Dameron ,I can fly anything. Why? Why are you helping me?
125,165,Finn (FN-2187),Because it's the right thing to do.
127,167,Poe Dameron ,You need a pilot.
129,169,Finn (FN-2187),I need a pilot.
131,171,Poe Dameron ,We're gonna do this.
133,173,Finn (FN-2187),Yeah?
135,175,Finn (FN-2187),Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.
137,177,Poe Dameron ,I am calm.
139,179,Finn (FN-2187),I'm talking to myself. Not yet. Okay go. This way.
141,191,Poe Dameron ,I've always wanted to fly one of these things. Can you shoot?
143,193,Finn (FN-2187),Blasters I can.
145,195,Poe Dameron ,Okay same principle. Use the toggle on the left... to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse.  Use the sight on the right to aim. Triggers to fire.
147,197,Finn (FN-2187),This is very complicated.
149,199,Poe Dameron ,I can fix this.
151,201,Some Guy,We have an unsanctioned departure from bay two. 
153,203,Captain,Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.
155,205,Officer,Fourteen failed. Eighteen...
157,207,Poe Dameron ,I got it. Woah! This thing really moves. We gotta take out as many of these cannons as we can...or we're not gonna get very far.
159,209,Finn (FN-2187),All right.
161,211,Poe Dameron ,I'm gonna get us in position. Just stay sharp. Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it? I got us dead center. It's a clean shot.
163,213,Finn (FN-2187),Okay got it. Yeah!
165,215,Poe Dameron ,Yes!
167,217,Finn (FN-2187),Did you see that? Did you see that?
169,219,Poe Dameron ,I saw it! Hey what's your name?
171,221,Finn (FN-2187),FN-2187.
173,223,Poe Dameron ,F... What?
175,225,Finn (FN-2187),That's the only name they ever gave me.
177,227,Poe Dameron ,Well I ain't using it. F-N huh? Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn. Is that all right?
179,229,Finn (FN-2187),Finn. Yeah. Finn I like that. I like that.
181,231,Poe Dameron ,I'm Poe. Poe Dameron. 
183,233,Finn (FN-2187),Good to meet you Poe.
185,235,Poe Dameron ,Good to meet you too Finn.
187,243,Captain,Sir they've taken out our turbo lasers.
189,245,General Hux,Use the ventral cannons.
191,247,Captain,Yes sir. Bringing them online.
193,249,Kylo Ren,General Hux is it the Resistance pilot?
195,251,General Hux,Yes and he had help... from one of our own. We're checking the registers now... to identify which stormtrooper it was.
197,253,Kylo Ren,The one from the village. FN-2187.
199,255,Captain,Sir ventral cannons hot.
201,257,General Hux,Fire.
203,263,Poe Dameron ,One's coming toward you! My right. Your left. Do you see it?
205,265,Finn (FN-2187),Hold on. I see him!
207,267,Poe Dameron ,Nice shot!
209,269,Finn (FN-2187),Where are we going?
211,271,Poe Dameron ,We're going back to Jakku. That's where.
213,273,Finn (FN-2187),No. We can't go back to Jakku. We need to get out of this system.
215,275,Poe Dameron ,I gotta get my droid before the First Order does.
217,277,Finn (FN-2187),What a droid?
219,279,Poe Dameron ,That's right. He's a BB unit orange and white. One of a kind.
221,281,Finn (FN-2187),I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important.
223,283,Poe Dameron ,This one is pal!
225,285,Finn (FN-2187),We gotta get as far away from the First Order as we can. We go back to Jakku we die.
227,287,Poe Dameron ,That droid has a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.
229,289,Finn (FN-2187),Oh you gotta be kidding me!
231,297,Phasma,FN-2187 reported to my division... was evaluated and sent to reconditioning.
233,299,General Hux,No prior signs of nonconformity?
235,301,Phasma,This was his first offense.
237,303,Officer,General! They've been hit.
239,305,General Hux,Destroyed?
241,307,Officer,Disabled. They were headed back to Jakku. The fighter is projected to crash in the Goazon badlands.
243,309,General Hux,They were going back for the droid. Send a squad to the wreckage.
245,313,Finn (FN-2187),Poe! Poe! Poe! Poe! I got you. Poe!
247,319,General Hux,Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must.
249,321,Kylo Ren,How capable are your soldiers General?
251,323,General Hux,I won't have you question my methods.
253,325,Kylo Ren,They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.
255,327,General Hux,My men are exceptionally trained. Programmed from birth.
257,329,Kylo Ren,Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.
259,331,General Hux,Careful Ren that your personal interests not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.
261,333,Kylo Ren,I want that map. For your sake... I suggest you get it.
263,343,Finn (FN-2187),Water. Water. Water. Is there water?
265,345,Rey,What? Oi get off him!
267,347,Finn (FN-2187),Hey!
269,349,Rey,They work for Unkar. That guy that wanted you. He must have really wanted you. Who? Him? What's your hurry thief?
271,351,Finn (FN-2187),What? Thief? Ow! Hey what?
273,353,Rey,The jacket. This droid says you stole it.
275,355,Finn (FN-2187),I've had a pretty messed up day all right? So I'd appreciate it... if you stop accusing me of... Ow! Stop it!
277,357,Rey,Where'd you get it? It belongs to his master.
279,359,Finn (FN-2187),It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name right? He was captured by the First Order. I helped him escape but our ship crashed. Poe didn't make it. I tried to help him. I'm sorry.
281,361,Rey,So you're with the Resistance?
283,363,Finn (FN-2187),Obviously. Yes I am. I'm with the Resistance yeah. I am with the Resistance.
285,365,Rey,I've never met a Resistance fighter before.
287,367,Finn (FN-2187),Well this is what we look like.  Some of us. Others look different.
289,369,Rey,BB-8 says he's on a secret mission. He has to get back to your base.
291,371,Finn (FN-2187),Apparently he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it.
293,373,Rey,Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a myth. What? What are you doing?
295,375,Finn (FN-2187),Come on. Come on BB-8!
297,377,Rey,Let go of me!
299,379,Finn (FN-2187),Come on we gotta move!
301,381,Rey,I know how to run without you holding my hand! BB-8 stay close! This way.
303,383,Storm Trooper,Call in the air strike.
305,385,Finn (FN-2187),Come on!
307,387,Rey,They're shooting at both of us.
309,389,Finn (FN-2187),Yeah. They saw you with me. You're marked.
311,391,Rey,Well thanks for that.
313,393,Finn (FN-2187),I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick. Does anyone have blasters around here?
315,395,Rey,Are you okay? Stop taking my hand! Hey-
317,397,Finn (FN-2187),Are you okay?
319,399,Rey,Yeah. Follow me.
321,401,Finn (FN-2187),We can't outrun them! 
323,403,Rey,We might... in that quadjumper!
325,405,Finn (FN-2187),Hey we need a pilot!
327,407,Rey,We've got one.
329,409,Finn (FN-2187),You? Uh what about that ship?
331,411,Rey,That one's garbage! The garbage will do. Gunner position is down there!
333,413,Finn (FN-2187),You ever fly this thing?
335,415,Rey,No! This ship hasn't flown in years.
337,417,Finn (FN-2187),Great. Whoa. I can do this. I can do this.
339,419,Rey,I can do this. I can do this.
341,421,Unkar,Hey! That's mine!
343,423,Finn (FN-2187),Wait stay low! Hey stay low!
345,425,Rey,What?
347,427,Finn (FN-2187),Stay low! It confuses their tracking.
349,429,Rey,BB-8 hold on! I'm going low! What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?
351,431,Finn (FN-2187),I'm working on it! Are the shields up?
353,433,Rey,Not so easy without a co-pilot!
355,435,Finn (FN-2187),Try sitting in this thing. We need cover quick!
357,437,Rey,We're about to get some! I hope.
359,439,Finn (FN-2187),Damn it! Come on come on!
361,441,Rey,Nice shot!
363,443,Finn (FN-2187),I'm getting pretty good at this. Uh the cannon's stuck in forward position. I can't move it. You gotta lose him!
365,445,Rey,Get ready!
367,447,Finn (FN-2187),Okay. For what? Are we really doing this?
369,449,Rey,Oh no.
371,451,Finn (FN-2187),Whoo!
373,457,Rey,Nice shooting.
375,459,Finn (FN-2187),Now that was some flying.
377,461,Rey,Thanks.
379,463,Finn (FN-2187),How did you do that?
381,465,Rey,I don't know.
383,467,Finn (FN-2187),No one trained you?
385,469,Rey,I've flown some ships but I've never left the planet. Your last shot was dead-on.
387,471,Finn (FN-2187),That was amazing.
389,473,Rey,You got him with one blast!
391,475,Finn (FN-2187),You set me up for it.
393,477,Rey,It was perfect.
395,479,Finn (FN-2187),That was pretty good.
397,481,Rey,You're okay. He's with the Resistance. He's gonna get you home. We both will. I don't know your name.
399,483,Finn (FN-2187),Finn. What's yours?
401,485,Rey,I'm Rey.
403,487,Finn (FN-2187),Rey...
405,489,Rey,Help me with this. Quick!
407,491,Finn (FN-2187),Whoa what's going on?
409,497,Officer,Sir... we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku. It escaped capture...aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.
411,499,Kylo Ren,The droid... stole a freighter?
413,501,Officer,Not exactly sir. It had help. We have no confirmation... but we believe FN-2187 may have helped in the escape.
415,503,Kylo Ren,Anything else?
417,505,Officer,The two were accompanied by a girl.
419,507,Kylo Ren,What girl?
421,519,Rey,It's the motivator. Grab me a Harris wrench check in there.
423,521,Finn (FN-2187),How bad is it?
425,523,Rey,If we wanna live not good.
427,525,Finn (FN-2187),They're hunting for us now. We've gotta get out of this system!
429,527,Rey,"BB-8 said the location of the Resistance base... is ""need to know"". If I'm taking you there I need to know!"
431,529,Finn (FN-2187),This? You gotta tell us where your base is. I don't speak that. All right between us... I'm not with the Resistance okay?  I'm just trying to get away from the First Order. But you tell us where the base is... I'll get you there first. Deal? Droid please!
433,531,Rey,Pilex driver hurry. So where's your base?
435,533,Finn (FN-2187),Go on BB-8 tell her. Please.
437,535,Rey,The lleenium system?
439,537,Finn (FN-2187),Yeah the lleenium system. That's the one. Get us there as fast as you can.
441,539,Rey,I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal. I need the bonding tape hurry!
443,541,Finn (FN-2187),What about you? 
445,543,Rey,I gotta get back to Jakku.
447,545,Finn (FN-2187),Back to Jak... Why does everyone wanna go back to Jakku?
449,547,Rey,It's not that one. No. No.
451,549,Finn (FN-2187),That place is...
453,551,Rey,The one I'm pointing to. No. No. No! If we don't patch it up...  the propulsion tank will overflow... and flood the ship with poisonous gas!
455,553,Finn (FN-2187),This?
457,555,Rey,Yes.
459,557,Finn (FN-2187),Hey Rey you're a pilot. You can fly anywhere. Why go back? You got a family? You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?
461,559,Rey, of your business that's why.
463,561,Finn (FN-2187),That can't be good.
465,563,Rey,No it can't be. Someone's locked on to us. All controls are overridden.  Get off! Get off! See anything?
467,565,Finn (FN-2187),Oh no. It's the First Order.
469,567,Rey,What do we do? There must be something.
471,569,Finn (FN-2187),You said poisonous gas.
473,571,Rey,I fixed that.
475,573,Finn (FN-2187),Can you unfix it?
477,575,Rey,Come on BB-8.
479,577,Finn (FN-2187),I got him. I'm okay. 
481,579,Rey,Do you think this will work on the stormtroopers?
483,581,Finn (FN-2187),Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke not toxins. Hurry. I'm hurrying.
485,583,Han Solo,Chewie... we're home. Where are the others? Where's the pilot?
487,585,Rey,I'm the pilot.
489,587,Han Solo,You?
491,589,Rey,No it's true. We're the only ones on board.
493,591,Finn (FN-2187),You can understand that thing?
495,593,Han Solo,"And ""that thing"" can understand you too... so watch it. Come on out of there. Where'd you get this ship?"
497,595,Rey,Niima Outpost.
499,597,Han Solo,Jakku? That junkyard?
501,599,Finn (FN-2187),Thank you! Junkyard.
503,601,Han Solo,Told you we should have double-checked the Western Reaches. Who had it? Ducain?
505,603,Rey,I stole it. From Unkar Plutt. He stole it from the Irving Boys who stole it from Ducain.
507,605,Han Solo,Who stole it from me! Well you tell him that Han Solo... just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.
509,607,Rey,This is  the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo? 
511,609,Han Solo,I used to be.
513,611,Finn (FN-2187),Han Solo the Rebellion general?
515,613,Rey,No the smuggler.
517,615,Finn (FN-2187),Wasn't he a war hero?
519,617,Rey,This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?
521,619,Han Solo,Twelve! Fourteen. Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line.
523,621,Rey,Unkar Plutt did.  I thought it was a mistake too. Puts too much...
525,623,Rey / Han,...stress on the hyperdrive.
527,625,Han Solo,Chewie throw them in a pod. We'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet.
529,627,Rey,Wait no. We need your help.
531,629,Han Solo,My help?
533,631,Rey,This droid has to get to the Resistance base... as soon as possible.
535,633,Finn (FN-2187),He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker. You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion. You knew him.
537,635,Han Solo,Yeah. I knew him. I knew Luke. Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.
539,637,Finn (FN-2187),Wait what? Did you just say Rathtars? Hey! You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter are you?
541,639,Han Solo,I'm hauling Rathtars. Oh great. It's the Guavian Death Gang. Must have tracked us from Nantoon.
543,641,Rey,What's a Rathtar?
545,643,Han Solo,They're big and they're dangerous.
547,645,Finn (FN-2187),You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?
549,647,Rey,No.
551,649,Finn (FN-2187),Good.
553,651,Han Solo,I got three of them going to King Prana.
555,653,Finn (FN-2187),Three? How'd you get them on board?
557,655,Han Solo,I used to have a bigger crew. Get below and stay there until I say so... and don't even think about taking the Falcon.
559,657,Rey,What about BB-8?
561,659,Han Solo,He stays with me until I get rid of the gang... then you can have him back and be on your way.
563,661,Finn (FN-2187),What about the Rathtars? Where are you keeping them?
565,663,Han Solo,There's one.
567,665,Rey,What are you gonna do?
569,667,Han Solo,Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it. Yes I do. Every time.
571,669,Bala-Tik,Han Solo. You're a dead man.
573,671,Han Solo,Bala-Tik. What's the problem?
575,673,Bala-Tik,The problem is we loaned you 5 for this job.
577,675,Rey,Can you see them?
579,677,Finn (FN-2187),No.
581,679,Bala-Tik,I heard you also borrowed 5 from Kanjiklub.
583,681,Han Solo,You know you can't trust those little freaks.
585,683,Bala-Tik,How long we known each other?
587,685,Rey,They have blasters.
589,687,Finn (FN-2187),A lot of them.
591,689,Bala-Tik,Not long. We want our money back now.
593,691,Han Solo,You think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.
595,693,Bala-Tik,Kanjiklub wants their investment back too.
597,695,Han Solo,I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!
599,698,Bala-Tik,Tell that to Kanjiklub.
601,701,Han Solo,Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
603,703,Han Solo,Boys you're both gonna get what I promised. Have I ever not delivered for you before?
605,705,Bala-Tik,Yeah.
607,707,Han Solo,What was the second time?
609,709,Bala-Tik,Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. That BB unit. The First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives.
611,711,Han Solo,First I've heard of it.
613,713,Rey,Wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor... we can trap both gangs!
615,715,Finn (FN-2187),We'll close the blast doors from here?
617,717,Rey,Resetting the fuses should do it.
619,719,Han Solo,I got a bad feeling about this.
621,721,Rey,Oh no.
623,723,Finn (FN-2187),Oh no what?
625,725,Rey,Wrong fuses.
627,727,Bala-Tik,Kill them! And take the droid!
629,729,Finn (FN-2187),This was a mistake!
631,731,Rey,Huge! What do they look like?
633,733,Finn (FN-2187),They look like that. This way.
635,735,Rey,Are you sure?
637,737,Finn (FN-2187),No no no!
639,739,Rey,Finn! Finn!
641,741,Finn (FN-2187),Rey!
643,743,Rey,Get Off! Get Off!
645,745,Finn (FN-2187),Rey!
647,747,Rey,Finn! Finn!
649,749,Finn (FN-2187),Get off me! Rey! Get off! Get off!
651,751,Rey,Finn!
653,753,Finn (FN-2187),It had me! But the door...
655,755,Rey,That was lucky.
657,757,Han Solo,I got the door. Cover us! Chewie! You okay? Wow. Come on! Come on!
659,759,Rey,Han.
661,761,Han Solo,You close the door behind us. You take care of Chewie! Hey where are you going?
663,763,Rey,Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too.  If we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.
665,765,Han Solo,I hate that guy.
667,767,Rey,And you could use a co-pilot.
669,769,Han Solo,I got one he's back there. Watch the thrust. We're going out of here at lightspeed.
671,771,Rey,From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?
673,773,Han Solo,I never ask that question till after I've done it. This is not how I thought this day was gonna go. Angle the shield. Hang on back there.
675,775,Finn (FN-2187),No problem!
677,777,Han Solo,Come on baby don't let me down. What?
679,779,Rey,Compressor.
681,781,Bala-Tik,Inform the First Order...  that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's  aboard the Millennium Falcon.
683,789,Snoke,The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns... the new Jedi will rise.
685,791,General Hux,Supreme Leader I take full responsibility...
687,793,Snoke,General! Our strategy must now change.
689,795,General Hux,The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it.  We shall destroy the government... that supports the Resistance... the Republic.  Without their friends to protect them... the Resistance will be vulnerable. And we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.
691,797,Snoke,Go. Oversee preparations.
693,799,General Hux,Yes Supreme Leader.
695,801,Snoke,There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?
697,803,Kylo Ren,Yes.
699,805,Snoke,There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father... Han Solo.
701,807,Kylo Ren,He means nothing to me.
703,809,Snoke,Even you master of the Knights of Ren... have never faced such a test.
705,811,Kylo Ren,By the grace of your training I will not be seduced.
707,813,Snoke,We shall see. We shall see.
709,823,Han Solo,Electrical overload.
711,825,Rey,I can fix that.
713,827,Han Solo,Coolant's leaking.
715,829,Rey,Try transferring auxiliary power...
717,831,Rey / Han,...to the secondary tank.
719,833,Han Solo,I got it.
721,835,Finn (FN-2187),Chewie come on! I need help with this giant hairy thing! Stop moving! Chewie!
723,837,Han Solo,You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me! 
725,840,Finn (FN-2187),Hurt him? He almost killed me six times! Which is fine!
727,843,Han Solo,This hyperdrive blows there are gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. What'd you do?
729,845,Rey,I bypassed the compressor.
731,847,Han Solo,Huh. Move ball. Ah don't say that. You did great. Just rest. Good job kid. Thanks.
733,849,Finn (FN-2187),You're welcome.
735,851,Han Solo,So... fugitives huh?
737,853,Rey,The First Order wants the map. Finn is with the Resistance. I'm just a scavenger.
739,855,Han Solo,Let's see what you got.
741,857,Rey,Go ahead.
743,859,Han Solo,This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared  people have been looking for him.
745,861,Rey,Why did he leave?
747,863,Han Solo,He was training a new generation of Jedi.  One boy an apprentice... turned against him destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He just walked away from everything.
749,865,Finn (FN-2187),Do you know what happened to him?
751,867,Han Solo,A lot of rumors. Stories. People that knew him best... think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. Think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.
753,869,Rey,The Jedi were real?
755,871,Han Solo,I used to wonder about that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil... the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is... it's true. The Force. The Jedi. All Of it. It's all true. No you rest. You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop.
757,879,Rey,I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy.
759,881,Finn (FN-2187),Hey Solo I'm not sure what we're walking into here...
761,883,Han Solo,Did you just call me Solo?
763,885,Finn (FN-2187),Sorry. Han. Mr.  You should know I'm a big deal in the Resistance.  Which puts a real target on my back. Are there any conspirators here? Like First Order sympathizers?
765,887,Han Solo,Listen Big Deal. You got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always. You might need this.
767,889,Rey,I think I can handle myself.
769,891,Han Solo,I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of those?
771,893,Rey,Yeah. You pull the trigger.
773,895,Han Solo,Little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?
775,897,Rey,Rey
777,899,Han Solo,Rey. I been thinking about bringing on some more crew Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me... appreciates the Falcon.
779,901,Rey,Are you offering me a job?
781,903,Han Solo,I wouldn't be nice to you. Doesn't pay much.
783,905,Rey,You're offering me a job.
785,907,Han Solo,I'm thinking about it. Well?
787,909,Rey,If you were I'd be flattered. But I have to get home.
789,911,Han Solo,Where Jakku?
791,913,Rey,I've already been away too long.
793,915,Han Solo,Chewie check out the ship as best you can. That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.
795,927,Finn (FN-2187),Solo why are we here again? 
797,929,Han Solo,To get your droid on a clean ship.
799,931,Rey,Clean?
801,933,Han Solo,You think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon?  If we can find it on our scanners... the First Order's not far behind. Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata's our best bet.
803,935,Finn (FN-2187),We can trust her right?
805,937,Han Solo,Relax kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste... so let me do the talking. And whatever you do don't stare.
807,939,Rey / Finn,At what?
809,941,Han Solo,Any of it.
811,943,Maz Kanata,Han Solo!
813,945,Han Solo,Oh boy. Hey Maz.
815,947,Maz Kanata,Where's my boyfriend?
817,949,Han Solo,Chewie's working on the Falcon.
819,951,Maz Kanata,I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it.
821,955,Kylo Ren,Forgive me.  I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again. The power of the darkness. And I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me... Grandfather...  and I Will finish... what you started.
823,971,Maz Kanata,A map. To Skywalker himself? You are right back in the mess.
825,973,Han Solo,Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia. 
827,975,Maz Kanata,Hmm... No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han. Go home.
829,977,Han Solo,Leia doesn't wanna see me.
831,979,Finn (FN-2187),Please we came here for your help.
833,981,Rey,What fight?
835,983,Maz Kanata,The only fight. Against the dark side. Through the ages... I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us.
837,985,Finn (FN-2187),There is no fight against the First Order. Not one we can win. Look around. There's no chance we haven't been recognized already. I bet you the First Order is on their way right...  What's this? What are you doing? Solo what is she doing?
839,987,Finn (FN-2187),I don't know. But it ain't good.
841,989,Maz Kanata,If you live long enough...   you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.
843,991,Finn (FN-2187),You don't know a thing about me. Where I'm from. We all need to run. What I've seen. You don't know the First Order like I do. They'll slaughter us. We all need to run.
845,993,Maz Kanata,Hmm. You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation... to the Outer Rim. There you can disappear.
847,995,Rey,Finn?
849,997,Finn (FN-2187),Come with me.
851,999,Rey,What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.
853,1001,Finn (FN-2187),I can't.
855,1003,Han Solo,Keep it kid.
857,1005,Maz Kanata,Who's the girl?
859,1007,Finn (FN-2187),I was told you can get me to the Outer Rim.
861,1009,Rey,What are you doing? 
863,1011,Finn (FN-2187),Don't leave without me.
865,1013,Rey,You can't just go. I won't let you.
867,1015,Finn (FN-2187),I'm not who you think I am.
869,1017,Rey,Finn what are you talking about?
871,1019,Finn (FN-2187),I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero. I'm a stormtrooper. Like all of them I was taken from a family I'll never know. And raised to do one thing. But my first battle I made a choice. I wasn't gonna kill for them. So I ran. Right into you. And you looked at me  like no one ever had. I was ashamed of what I was. But I'm done with the First Order. I'm never going back. Rey come with me. 
873,1021,Rey,Don't go.
875,1023,Finn (FN-2187),Take care of yourself. Please.
877,1025,Rey,No! 
879,1027,Yoda,Its energy...  surrounds us... and binds us...
881,1029,Obi Wan,The Force will be...
883,1031,Rey,No! Come back!
885,1033,Unkar,Quiet girl.
887,1035,Obi Wan,Rey? These are your first steps.
889,1037,Rey,What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.
891,1039,Maz Kanata,That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him. And now it calls to you.
893,1041,Rey,I have to get back to Jakku. 
895,1043,Maz Kanata,Han told me. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku... they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. 
897,1045,Rey,Luke. 
899,1048,Maz Kanata,The belonging you seek is not behind you... it is ahead. I am no Jedi but I know the Force.  It moves through and surrounds every living thing.  Close your eyes. Feel it. The light... it's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it.
901,1051,Rey,I'm never touching that thing again. I don't want any part of this.
903,1053,Maz Kanata,Hmm.
905,1061,General Hux,Today is the end of the Republic. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. At this very moment in a system far from here... the New Republic lies to the galaxy... while secretly supporting the treachery... of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet!  All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this as the last day of the Republic!
907,1063,Officer,Confirm transfer to manual control. Configure!
909,1065,General Hux,Fire!
911,1067,Citizen,No. What is it? 
913,1089,Finn (FN-2187),It was the Republic. The First Order they've done it. Where's Rey?
915,1091,Rey,What are you doing? You have to go back. I'm leaving. BB-8... No you can't. You have to go back you're too important. They'll help you.
917,1093,Maz Kanata,I've had this for ages. Kept it locked away.
919,1095,Han Solo,Where'd you get that?
921,1097,Maz Kanata,A good question. For another time. Take it. Find your friend! Those beasts. They're here.
923,1099,Storm Trooper,FN-417 hold position.
925,1101,Rey,Oh safety.
927,1103,Storm Trooper,Sir. The droid was spotted heading west. With a girl.
929,1105,Rey,You have to keep going. Stay out of sight. I'll try to fight them off. I hope so too.
931,1107,Han Solo,Come on Chewie!
933,1109,Rey,Rey and BB-8! They need you! Now! Go!
935,1111,Finn (FN-2187),I need a weapon!
937,1113,Maz Kanata,You have one!
939,1115,Han Solo,Hey can I try that? I like this thing.
941,1117,Storm Trooper,Traitor!
943,1119,Han Solo,You okay Big Deal?
945,1121,Finn (FN-2187),Thanks.
947,1123,Storm Trooper,Don't move- TK-338 we have targets in custody.
949,1125,Storm Trooper 2,We have incoming at 28. 6.
951,1127,Storm Trooper 3,Move! Move! Move! Scramble all squads repeat scramble all squads! Head to higher cover and wait for our position! It's the Resistance.
953,1129,Poe Dameron ,Go straight at them! Don't let these dogs scare you!
955,1131,Unknown Lady,Copy that.
957,1133,Unknown Man,We're with you Poe.
959,1135,Han Solo,Quick!
961,1137,Finn (FN-2187),Whoo! Yeah! That's one hell of a pilot!
963,1139,Poe Dameron ,Whoo-hoo!
965,1145,Kylo Ren,The girl I've heard so much about. The droid. Where is it?
967,1147,Storm Trooper,Request air support.
969,1149,Kylo Ren,The map. You've seen it.
971,1151,Storm Trooper,Sir Resistance fighters. We need more troops.
973,1153,Kylo Ren,Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need.
975,1155,Storm Trooper,Pull back to tree line!
977,1167,Finn (FN-2187),No! No no! No! No! Rey! He took her. Did you see that? He took her. She's gone.
979,1169,Han Solo,Yeah I know.
981,1171,Commander,Let's go! 
983,1173,C-3PO,Goodness! Han Solo! It is I C-3PO. You probably don't recognize me... because of the red arm. Look who it is did you see who... Uh... Hmm. Excuse me Prin... General. Sorry. Come along BB-8 quickly. Yes I must get my proper arm reinstalled.
985,1175,Han Solo,You changed your hair.
987,1177,Leia,Same jacket.
989,1179,Han Solo,No new jacket. I saw him. Leia I saw our son. He was here.
991,1185,Poe Dameron ,BB-8 my buddy. Oh it's so good to see you. Finn saved you? Where is he?
993,1187,Finn (FN-2187),Poe?
995,1189,Poe Dameron ,Oh No.
997,1191,Finn (FN-2187),Poe Dameron you're alive?
999,1193,Poe Dameron ,Buddy! So are you!
1001,1195,Finn (FN-2187),What happened to you?
1003,1197,Poe Dameron ,I got thrown from the crash.  I woke up at night. No you. No ship. Nothing. BB-8 says that you saved him.
1005,1199,Finn (FN-2187),No no no. It wasn't just me. 
1007,1201,Poe Dameron ,You completed my mission Finn... That's my jacket.
1009,1203,Finn (FN-2187),Oh...
1011,1205,Poe Dameron ,No no no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man Finn.
1013,1207,Finn (FN-2187),Poe I need your help.
1015,1225,Announcer,PZ-4CO report to communications.
1017,1227,Poe Dameron ,General Organa... I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn. He needs to talk to you.
1019,1229,Leia,And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave what you did.  Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life.
1021,1231,Finn (FN-2187),Thank you ma'am. But a friend of mine was taken prisoner.
1023,1233,Leia,Han told me about the girl. I'm sorry.
1025,1235,Poe Dameron ,Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.
1027,1237,Leia,We're desperate for anything you can tell us.
1029,1239,Finn (FN-2187),That's where my friend was taken. I've got to get there fast.
1031,1241,Leia,And I will do everything I can to help... but first you need to tell us all you know.
1033,1243,Woman,That sounds very scary. You must be so brave.
1035,1245,C-3PO,General... I regret to inform you...but this map recovered from BB-8... is only partially complete. And even worse it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information... to locate Master Luke.
1037,1247,Leia,Can't believe I was so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home.
1039,1249,Han Solo,Leia.
1041,1251,Leia,Don't do that.
1043,1253,Han Solo,Do what?
1045,1255,Leia,Anything-
1047,1257,C-3PO,Princesses.
1049,1259,Han Solo,I'm trying to be helpful.
1051,1261,Leia,When did that ever help?  And don't say the Death Star.
1053,1263,C-3PO,BB-8. You're wasting your time. It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low-power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly he may never be his old self again.
1055,1265,Han Solo,Listen to me will you? I know every time you... Every time you look at me you're reminded of him.
1057,1267,Leia,You think I want to forget him? I want him back.
1059,1269,Han Solo,There's nothing more we could have done. There's too much Vader in him.
1061,1271,Leia,That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.
1063,1273,Han Solo,We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever any good at. 
1065,1276,Leia,We both did.
1067,1279,Han Solo,We lost our son. Forever.
1069,1281,Leia,No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.
1071,1283,Han Solo,If Luke couldn't reach him how could I?
1073,1285,Leia,Luke is a Jedi. You're his father. There is still light in him I know it.
1075,1287,Officer,General the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.
1077,1293,Rey,Where am I?
1079,1295,Kylo Ren,You're my guest.
1081,1297,Rey,Where are the others?
1083,1299,Kylo Ren,Do you mean the murderers... traitors and thieves you call friends? You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea. You still want to kill me.
1085,1301,Rey,That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.
1087,1303,Kylo Ren,Tell me about the droid.
1089,1305,Rey,He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.
1091,1307,Kylo Ren,It's carrying a section of a navigational chart. And we have the rest. Recovered from the archives of the Empire but we need the last piece. And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger. You know I can take whatever I want. You're so lonely. So afraid to leave. At night desperate to sleep. You imagine an ocean. I see it. I see the island. And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would have disappointed you.
1093,1309,Rey,Get out of my head.
1095,1311,Kylo Ren,I know you've seen the map. It's in there. And now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too.
1097,1313,Rey,I'm not giving you anything.
1099,1315,Kylo Ren,We'll see. You. You're afraid. That you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.
1101,1323,Snoke,The scavenger... resisted you?
1103,1325,Kylo Ren,She is strong with the Force. Untrained but stronger than she knows.
1105,1327,Snoke,And the droid?
1107,1329,General Hux,Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. That the girl was all we needed. As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already.
1109,1331,Snoke,Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.
1111,1333,General Hux,We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the lleenium system.
1113,1335,Snoke,Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon.
1115,1337,Kylo Ren,Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance.
1117,1339,Snoke,If what you say about this girl is true... Bring her to me.
1119,1351,Rey,You will remove these restraints... and leave this cell with the door open.
1121,1353,Storm Trooper 6,What did you say?
1123,1355,Rey,You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.
1125,1357,Storm Trooper 6,I'll tighten those restraints... scavenger scum.
1127,1359,Rey,You will remove these restraints... and leave this cell with the door open.
1129,1361,Storm Trooper 6,I will remove these restraints and leave the cell with the door open.
1131,1363,Rey,And you'll drop your weapon.
1133,1365,Storm Trooper 6,And I'll drop my weapon
1135,1367,Kylo Ren,No. No. Guards! Guards!
1137,1369,General Hux,Begin charging the weapon.
1139,1371,Officer,Yes sir. Weapon charging.
1141,1393,Poe Dameron ,The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.
1143,1395,Officer,They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
1145,1397,Officer 2,A laser cannon?
1147,1399,Officer,We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.
1149,1401,Emmat,It's another Death Star.
1151,1403,Poe Dameron ,I wish that were the case Major. This was the Death Star. And this is Starkiller Base.
1153,1405,Han Solo,So it's big.
1155,1407,Unknown Creature,How is it possible to power a weapon of that size?
1157,1409,Finn (FN-2187),It uses the power of the sun. As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears.
1159,1411,Officer,Ma'am.
1161,1413,Leia,The First Order they're charging the weapon again now. Our system is the next target.
1163,1415,C-3PO,Oh my. Without the Republic fleet we're doomed.
1165,1417,Han Solo,Okay. How do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that.
1167,1419,Leia,Han's right.
1169,1421,Statura,In order for that amount of power to be contained... that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator.
1171,1423,Finn (FN-2187),There is one. Precinct 47. Here
1173,1425,Statura,If we can destroy that oscillator... it might destabilize the core and cripple the weapon. 
1175,1427,Officer,Maybe the planet.
1177,1429,Poe Dameron ,We'll go in there we'll hit that oscillator with everything we've got.
1179,1431,Unknown Creature,They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.
1181,1433,Han Solo,We disable the shields. Kid you worked there. What do you got?
1183,1435,Finn (FN-2187),I can do it.
1185,1437,Han Solo,I like this guy.
1187,1439,Finn (FN-2187),I can disable the shields but I have to be there. On the planet.
1189,1441,Han Solo,We'll get you there.
1191,1443,Leia,Han how?
1193,1445,Han Solo,If I told you you wouldn't like it.
1195,1447,Poe Dameron ,So we disable the shields we take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go.
1197,1455,Han Solo,Chewie check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. Finn be careful with those. They're explosives.
1199,1457,Finn (FN-2187),Now you tell me?
1201,1459,Leia,You know no matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave.
1203,1461,Han Solo,That's why I did it.  So you'd miss me.
1205,1463,Leia,I did miss you.
1207,1465,Han Solo,It wasn't all bad was it? Huh? Some of it was... good.
1209,1467,Leia,Pretty good.
1211,1469,Han Solo,Some things never change.
1213,1471,Leia,True. You still drive me crazy. If you see our son... bring him home.
1215,1479,Storm Trooper 6,Sir sensors triggered in Hangar 718. We're searching the area.
1217,1481,Kylo Ren,She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her... the more dangerous she becomes.
1219,1483,Announcer,All sentry droids... all sentry droids... resynchronize to Galactic Standard Time. Offset 473.
1221,1489,Finn (FN-2187),How are we getting in?
1223,1491,Han Solo,Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.
1225,1493,Finn (FN-2187),We're making our landing approach at lightspeed?
1227,1495,Han Solo,Chewie get ready. And... Now! I am pulling up! I get any higher... they'll see us!
1229,1515,Officer,Sir she was not found in Hangar 718. But all troops are on alert.
1231,1517,Kylo Ren,Put every hangar on lockdown. She's going to try to steal a ship to esc... Han Solo.
1233,1519,Finn (FN-2187),The flooding tunnel is over that ridge. We'll get in that way.
1235,1521,Han Solo,What was your job when you were based here?
1237,1523,Finn (FN-2187),Sanitation. 
1239,1525,Han Solo,Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?
1241,1527,Finn (FN-2187),I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.
1243,1529,Han Solo,People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.
1245,1531,Finn (FN-2187),Solo we'll figure it out. We'll use the Force.
1247,1533,Han Solo,That's not how the Force works. Oh really? You're cold?
1249,1535,Finn (FN-2187),Come on.
1251,1537,General Hux,Report.
1253,1539,Officer,Weapon charged in 15 minutes sir.
1255,1541,Storm Trooper 6,Hey!
1257,1543,Han Solo,The longer we're here the less luck we're gonna have. The shields.
1259,1545,Finn (FN-2187),I have an idea about that. You remember me?
1261,1547,Phasma,FN-2187.
1263,1549,Finn (FN-2187),Not anymore. The name's Finn and I'm in charge. I'm in charge now Phasma. I'm in charge.
1265,1551,Han Solo,Bring it down. Bring it down.
1267,1553,Finn (FN-2187),Yeah. Follow me.
1269,1555,Storm Trooper 4,Have you checked out the new T-17s?
1271,1557,Storm Trooper 7,The T-17s as far as I can tell... are a great improvement.
1273,1559,Storm Trooper 4,Yeah. That's what they tell you. But believe me they don't hold up.
1275,1561,Storm Trooper 7,They don't?
1277,1563,Storm Trooper 4,No.
1279,1565,Finn (FN-2187),You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.
1281,1567,Phasma,You're making a big mistake.
1283,1569,Finn (FN-2187),Do it. Solo if this works... we're not gonna have a lot of time to find Rey.
1285,1571,Han Solo,Don't worry kid. We won't leave here without her.
1287,1573,Phasma,You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.
1289,1575,Han Solo,I disagree. 
1291,1577,Finn (FN-2187),What do we do with her? 
1293,1579,Han Solo,Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?
1295,1581,Finn (FN-2187),Yeah there is.
1297,1597,Officer,General their shields are down.
1299,1599,C-3PO,Thank the Maker!
1301,1601,Leia,Han did it. Send them in.
1303,1603,Statura,Give Poe full authorization for attack.
1305,1605,Officer 2,Black Leader go to sub-lights on your call.
1307,1607,Poe Dameron ,Roger base. Red squad Blue squad take my lead. Dropping out of lightspeed. Almost in range. Hit the target dead center. As many runs as we can get.
1309,1609,Pilot,Approaching target.
1311,1635,Officer,Fighters incoming!
1313,1637,Officer 2,Coming at 28.336.
1315,1639,Officer 3,Forty-five! Shields up! Shields up!
1317,1641,General Hux,Dispatch all squadrons.
1319,1643,Captain,Yes General.
1321,1645,Poe Dameron ,All right. Let's light it up.
1323,1647,Pilot 2,Ah direct hit.
1325,1649,Pilot 3 ,But no damage!
1327,1651,Poe Dameron ,Yeah we gotta keep hitting it. Another bombing run. Remember when the sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire. But as long as there's light we got a chance. Guys we got a lot of company!
1329,1653,Storm Trooper 6,We think they may be splitting up. Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.
1331,1655,Finn (FN-2187),We'll use the charges to blow that blast door. I'll go in and draw fire but I'm gonna need cover.
1333,1657,Han Solo,You sure you're up for this?
1335,1659,Finn (FN-2187),Hell no. I'll go in and try to find Rey. The troopers will be on our tail. We have to be ready for that. There's an access tunnel that leads... Why are you doing that? Hmm? Why are you doing this? I'm trying to come up with a plan.
1337,1661,Han Solo,You all right?
1339,1663,Rey,Yeah.
1341,1665,Han Solo,Good.
1343,1667,Finn (FN-2187),What happened to you? Did he hurt you?
1345,1669,Rey,Finn what are you doing here?
1347,1671,Finn (FN-2187),We came back for you. What'd he say?
1349,1673,Rey,That it was your idea. Thank you.
1351,1675,Finn (FN-2187),How did you get away?
1353,1677,Rey,I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.
1355,1679,Han Solo,Escape now hug later. 
1357,1709,Pilot,I got one behind me. You see it?
1359,1711,Jess,Yeah. I'm on it. Burillo's been hit.
1361,1713,Pilot,Watch out for ground fire.
1363,1715,Han Solo,They're in trouble. We can't leave. My friend's got a bag full of explosives. Let's use them.
1365,1717,Officer,General are you seeing this?
1367,1719,Controller,Two more X-wings down. That's half our fleet destroyed.
1369,1721,C-3PO,And their weapon will be fully charged in ten minutes. It would take a miracle to save us now.
1371,1723,Han Solo,Ah. Girl knows her stuff. We'll set the charges against every other column. You're right. That's a better idea. You take the top. I'll go down below. Detonator. We'll meet back here.
1373,1725,Kylo Ren,Find them.
1375,1727,Han Solo,Ben!
1377,1729,Kylo Ren,Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.
1379,1731,Han Solo,Take off that mask. You don't need it.
1381,1733,Kylo Ren,What do you think you'll see if I do?
1383,1735,Han Solo,The face of my son.
1385,1737,Kylo Ren,Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish like his father. 
1387,1739,Han Solo,That's what Snoke wants you to believe. But it's not true. My son is alive.
1389,1741,Kylo Ren,No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
1391,1743,Han Solo,Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants he'll crush you. You know it's true.
1393,1745,Kylo Ren,It's too late. 
1395,1747,Han Solo,No it's not. Leave here with me. Come home. We miss you.
1397,1750,Kylo Ren,I'm being torn apart. I want to be free of this pain. I know what I have to do but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. Will you help me?
1399,1753,Han Solo,Yes. Anything.
1401,1755,Rey,No!
1403,1757,Kylo Ren,Thank you.
1405,1759,Rey,No.
1407,1761,Controller,The oscillator's been damaged... but is still functional.
1409,1763,Girl Officer,Admiral their weapon will fire in two minutes.
1411,1765,Finn (FN-2187),The Falcon's this way.
1413,1767,Kylo Ren,We're not done yet.
1415,1769,Rey,You're a monster.
1417,1771,Kylo Ren,It's just us now. Han Solo can't save you.
1419,1773,Finn (FN-2187),Rey! REY! Oh no. No no. REY! 
1421,1775,Kylo Ren,Traitor! That lightsaber. It belongs to me.
1423,1777,Finn (FN-2187),Come get it.
1425,1779,Pilot,We just lost R-1.
1427,1781,Jess,We're overwhelmed. What do we do? It isn't working.
1429,1783,Pilot 2,Black Leader there's a brand new hole in that oscillator. Looks like our friends got in.
1431,1785,Poe Dameron ,Red Four Red Six cover us.
1433,1787,Pilot 2,I'm on it.
1435,1789,Pilot 3 ,Roger.
1437,1791,Poe Dameron ,Everybody else hit the target hard. Give it everything you got. I need some help here. I need some help!
1439,1793,Pilot,Coming in!
1441,1795,Jess,Watch out!
1443,1797,Pilot,I'm hit!
1445,1799,Poe Dameron ,All teams I'm going in. Pull up and cover me.
1447,1801,Pilot 2,Copy that Black Leader. Good luck Poe.
1449,1803,Officer,Weapon fully charged in 3 seconds.
1451,1805,General Hux,Prepare to fire.
1453,1811,Kylo Ren,You need a teacher. I could show you the ways of the Force.
1455,1813,Rey,The Force?
1457,1827,Officer,All eyes on that TIE fighter.
1459,1829,Officer 2,We're losing power rapidly!
1461,1831,Captain,Lieutenant! Get back to your station!
1463,1833,Lieutenant,Just look! We won't survive. Even Hux is gone.
1465,1835,General Hux,Supreme Leader. The fuel cells have ruptured. The collapse of the planet has begun.
1467,1837,Snoke,Leave the base at once and come to me with Kylo Ren. It is time...to complete his training.
1469,1845,Rey,Finn! Finn!
1471,1847,Poe Dameron ,All teams I got eyes on them.
1473,1849,Pilot,Yes!
1475,1851,Poe Dameron ,Our job's done here. Let's go home.
1477,1863,Medic,Easy easy. He's hurt. We've got a heartbeat.
1479,1865,C-3PO,R2-D2! You've come back. You found what? How dare you call me that! Find Master Luke how? Come R2. We must go tell the others at once! General. Excuse me General. R2 may contain some much-needed good news.
1481,1867,Leia,Tell me.
1483,1869,Poe Dameron ,Yeah. All right buddy. Hold on.
1485,1871,C-3PO,The map it is complete.
1487,1873,Leia,Luke.
1489,1875,C-3PO,Oh my dear friend... how I've missed you.
1491,1877,Rey,We'll see each other again. I believe that. Thank you my friend.
1493,1879,Leia,Rey. May the Force be with you.
