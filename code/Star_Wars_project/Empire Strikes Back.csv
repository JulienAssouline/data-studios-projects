81,THREEPIO,Don't try to blame me.  I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater.  I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber.  But it's supposed to be freezing.  How are we going to dry out all her clothes?  I really don't know.,Empire Strike Back

209,HAN,That's two you owe me junior.,Empire Strike Back
211,HAN,Well your Worship looks like you managed to keep me around fora little while longer.,Empire Strike Back

213,HAN,That's a good story.  I think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.,Empire Strike Back

234,RIEEKAN,We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve moving east.,Empire Strike Back
235,SENIOR CONTROLLER,It's metal.,Empire Strike Back
236,LEIA,Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.,Empire Strike Back
237,HAN,It could be a speeder one of ours.,Empire Strike Back
238,SENIOR CONTROLLER,No.  Wait - there's something very weak coming through.,Empire Strike Back
240,THREEPIO,Sir I am fluent in six million forms of communication.  This signal is not used by the Alliance.  It could be an Imperial code.,Empire Strike Back

255,RIEEKAN,We'd better start the evacuation.,Empire Strike Back
260,PIETT,Admiral.,Empire Strike Back
261,OZZEL,Yes Captain,Empire Strike Back
262,PIETT,I think we've got something sir.  The report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the Hoth system but it's the best lead we've had.,Empire Strike Back
263,OZZEL, We have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy.  I want proof not leads!,Empire Strike Back
264,PIETT,The visuals indicate life readings.,Empire Strike Back
265,OZZEL,It could mean anything.  If we followed every lead...,Empire Strike Back
266,PIETT,But sir the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms.,Empire Strike Back
268,VADER,You found something?,Empire Strike Back
269,PIETT,Yes my lord.,Empire Strike Back
270,VADER, That's it.  The Rebels are there.,Empire Strike Back
271,OZZEL,My lord there are so many uncharted settlements.  It could be smugglers it could be...,Empire Strike Back
272,VADER,That is the system.  And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.  Set your course for the Hoth system.  General Veers prepare you men.,Empire Strike Back

305,VADER,What is it General?,Empire Strike Back
306,VEERS,My lord the fleet has moves out of light-speed.  Com-Scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the Hoth system.  The field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment.,Empire Strike Back
307,VADER,The Rebels are alerted to our presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out of light-speed too close to the system.,Empire Strike Back
308,VEERS,He felt surprise was wiser...,Empire Strike Back

317,PIETT,Thank you Lord Vader.,Empire Strike Back
321,LEIA,All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance.  The heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded.  Only two fighter escorts per ship.  The energy shield can only be opened for a short time so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.,Empire Strike Back
322,HOBBIE,Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?,Empire Strike Back
323,LEIA,The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path.  When you've gotten past the energy shield proceed directly to the rendezvous point.  Understood?,Empire Strike Back

778,VADER,Yes Admiral?,Empire Strike Back
779,PIETT,Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon lord.  But... it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...,Empire Strike Back
780,VADER,Asteroids do not concern me Admiral.  I want that ship and not excuses.,Empire Strike Back
781,PIETT,Yes lord.,Empire Strike Back
786,HAN,I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems.  ,Empire Strike Back
787,THREEPIO,Sir I'm almost afraid to ask but... does that include shutting me down too?,Empire Strike Back
789,HAN,No I need you to talk to the Falcon find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.,Empire Strike Back
791,THREEPIO,Sir it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.,Empire Strike Back
792,HAN,Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.  Chewie take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive.,Empire Strike Back
793,THREEPIO,Oh!  Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior.  After all I'm only trying to do my job in the most...,Empire Strike Back

862,THREEPIO,Oh where is Artoo when I need him?,Empire Strike Back
864,THREEPIO,Sir I don't know where your ship learned to communicate but it has the most peculiar dialect.  I believe sir it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized.  I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.,Empire Strike Back
865,HAN,Well of course I'll have to replace it.,Empire Strike Back
867,HAN,Here!  And Chewie...,Empire Strike Back
869,HAN,... I think we'd better replace the negative power coupling.,Empire Strike Back
871,HAN,Hey Your Worship I'm only trying to help.,Empire Strike Back
872,LEIA,Would you please stop calling me that?,Empire Strike Back
874,HAN,Sure Leia.,Empire Strike Back

878,LEIA,Occasionally...... when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.,Empire Strike Back
879,HAN,Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like the sound of that.,Empire Strike Back
881,LEIA,Stop that.,Empire Strike Back
882,HAN,Stop what?,Empire Strike Back
884,LEIA,Stop that!  My hands are dirty.,Empire Strike Back
885,HAN,My hands are dirty too.  What are you afraid of?,Empire Strike Back
886,LEIA,Afraid?,Empire Strike Back
888,HAN,You're trembling.,Empire Strike Back
889,LEIA,I'm not trembling.,Empire Strike Back
891,HAN,You like me because I'm a scoundrel.There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.,Empire Strike Back
893,LEIA,I happen to like nice men.,Empire Strike Back
894,HAN,I'm a nice man.,Empire Strike Back
895,LEIA,No you're not.  You're...,Empire Strike Back
898,THREEPIO,Sir sir!  I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.,Empire Strike Back
900,HAN,Thank you.  Thank you very much.,Empire Strike Back
901,THREEPIO,Oh you're perfectly welcome sir.,Empire Strike Back
907,NEEDA,... and that Lord Vader was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes.  Considering the amount of damage we've sustained they must have been destroyed.,Empire Strike Back
908,VADER,No Captain they're alive.  I want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found.,Empire Strike Back
910,PIETT,Lord Vader.,Empire Strike Back
911,VADER,Yes Admiral what is it?,Empire Strike Back
913,PIETT,The Emperor commands you make contact with him.,Empire Strike Back
914,VADER,Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission.,Empire Strike Back
915,PIETT,Yes my lord.,Empire Strike Back
921,VADER,What is thy bidding my master?,Empire Strike Back
922,EMPEROR,There is a great disturbance in the Force.,Empire Strike Back
923,VADER,I have felt it.,Empire Strike Back
924,EMPEROR,We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker.,Empire Strike Back
925,VADER,Yes my master.,Empire Strike Back
926,EMPEROR,He could destroy us.,Empire Strike Back
927,VADER,He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no longer help him.,Empire Strike Back
928,EMPEROR,The Force is strong with him.  The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.,Empire Strike Back
929,VADER,If he could be turned he would become a powerful ally.,Empire Strike Back
930,EMPEROR,Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great asset.  Can it be done?,Empire Strike Back
931,VADER,He will join us or die my master.,Empire Strike Back
938,LUKE,Look I'm sure it's delicious.  I just don't understand why we can't see Yoda now.,Empire Strike Back
939,CREATURE,Patience!  For the Jedi it is time to eat as well.  Eat eat.  Hot.  Good food hm? Good hmm?,Empire Strike Back
941,LUKE,How far away is Yoda?  Will it take us long to get there?,Empire Strike Back
942,CREATURE,Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.Soon you will be with him.Rootleaf I cook.  Why wish you become Jedi?  Hm?,Empire Strike Back
943,LUKE,Mostly because of my father I guess.,Empire Strike Back
944,CREATURE,Ah your father.  Powerful Jedi was he powerful Jedi mmm.,Empire Strike Back
945,LUKE,Oh I don't know what I'm doing here.  We're wasting our time.,Empire Strike Back
947,CREATURE,I cannot teach him.  The boy has no patience.,Empire Strike Back
949,BEN'S VOICE,He will learn patience.,Empire Strike Back
950,YODA,Hmmm.  Much anger in him like his father.,Empire Strike Back
951,BEN'S VOICE,Was I any different when you taught me?,Empire Strike Back
952,YODA,Hah.  He is not ready.,Empire Strike Back
953,LUKE,Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I can be a Jedi.  Ben tell him I'm ready.,Empire Strike Back
955,YODA,Ready are you?  What know you of ready?  For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained!A Jedi must have the deepest commitment the most serious mind.You are reckless!,Empire Strike Back
957,BEN'S VOICE,So was I if you'll remember.,Empire Strike Back
958,YODA,He is too old.  Yes too old to begin the training.,Empire Strike Back
960,LUKE,But I've learned so much.,Empire Strike Back
962,YODA,Will he finished what he begins?,Empire Strike Back
963,LUKE,I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.,Empire Strike Back
964,YODA,Oh you will be.  You will be.,Empire Strike Back
972,THREEPIO,Sir if I may venture an opinion...,Empire Strike Back
973,HAN,I'm not really interested in your opinion Threepio.,Empire Strike Back
975,LEIA,There's something out there.,Empire Strike Back
976,HAN,Where?,Empire Strike Back
977,LEIA,Outside in the cave.,Empire Strike Back
979,THREEPIO,There it is.  Listen!  Listen!,Empire Strike Back
980,HAN,I'm going out there.,Empire Strike Back
981,LEIA,Are you crazy?!,Empire Strike Back
982,HAN,I just got this bucket back together.  I'm not going to let something tear it apart.,Empire Strike Back
984,LEIA,Then I'm going with you.,Empire Strike Back
985,THREEPIO,I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship.Oh no.,Empire Strike Back
989,LEIA,This ground sure feels strange.It doesn't feel like rock at all.,Empire Strike Back
991,HAN,There's an awful lot of moisture in here.,Empire Strike Back
992,LEIA,I don't know.  I have a bad feeling about this.,Empire Strike Back
993,HAN,Yeah.,Empire Strike Back
995,HAN,Watch out!,Empire Strike Back
997,HAN,Yeah that's what I thought.Mynock.  Chewie check the rest of the ship make sure there aren't any more attached.  They're chewing on the power cables.,Empire Strike Back
998,LEIA,Mynocks?,Empire Strike Back
999,HAN,Go on inside.  We'll clean them off if there are any more.,Empire Strike Back
1001,THREEPIO,Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!,Empire Strike Back
1003,HAN,Wait a minute...,Empire Strike Back
1008,HAN,All right Chewie let's get out of here!,Empire Strike Back
1010,LEIA,The Empire is still out there.I don't think it's wise to...,Empire Strike Back
1012,HAN,No time to discuss this incommittee.,Empire Strike Back
1014,LEIA,I am not a committee!,Empire Strike Back
1017,LEIA,You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...,Empire Strike Back
1018,HAN,Sit down sweetheart.  We're taking off!,Empire Strike Back
1020,THREEPIO,Look!,Empire Strike Back
1021,HAN,I see it I see it.,Empire Strike Back
1023,THREEPIO,We're doomed!,Empire Strike Back
1024,LEIA,The cave is collapsing.,Empire Strike Back
1025,HAN,This is no cave.,Empire Strike Back
1026,LEIA,What?,Empire Strike Back
1036,YODA,Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware of the dark side.  Anger... fear... aggression.  The dark side of the Force are they.Easily they flow quick to join you in a fight.  If once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny consume you it will as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.,Empire Strike Back
1037,LUKE,Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?,Empire Strike Back
1038,YODA,No... no... no.  Quicker easier more seductive.,Empire Strike Back
1039,LUKE,But how am I to know the good side from the bad?,Empire Strike Back
1040,YODA,You will know.  When you are calm at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense never for attack.,Empire Strike Back
1041,LUKE,But tell me why I can't...,Empire Strike Back
1042,YODA,No no there is no why.  Nothing more will I teach you today.Clear your mind of questions.  Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.,Empire Strike Back
1045,LUKE,There's something not right here.,Empire Strike Back
1047,LUKE,I feel cold death.,Empire Strike Back
1048,YODA,That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force.  A domain of evil it is.  In you must go.,Empire Strike Back
1049,LUKE,What's in there?,Empire Strike Back
1050,YODA,Only what you take with you.,Empire Strike Back
1052,YODA,Your weapons... you will not need them.,Empire Strike Back
1067,PIETT,Bounty hunters.  We don't need that scum.,Empire Strike Back
1068,FIRST CONTROLLER,Yes sir.,Empire Strike Back
1069,PIETT,Those Rebels won't escape us.,Empire Strike Back
1071,SECOND CONTROLLER,Sir we have a priority signal from the Star Destroyer Avenger.,Empire Strike Back
1072,PIETT,Right.,Empire Strike Back
1074,VADER,... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.  You are free to use any methods necessary but I want them alive.  No disintegrations.,Empire Strike Back
1075,BOBA FETT,As you wish.,Empire Strike Back
1077,PIETT,Lord Vader!  My lord we have them.,Empire Strike Back
1082,THREEPIO,Oh thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.,Empire Strike Back
1088,HAN,Let's get out of here.  Ready for light-speed?  One... two... three!,Empire Strike Back
1090,HAN,It's not fair!,Empire Strike Back
1092,HAN,The transfer circuits are working.It's not my fault!,Empire Strike Back
1094,LEIA,No light-speed?,Empire Strike Back
1095,HAN,It's not my fault.,Empire Strike Back
1096,THREEPIO,Sir we just lost the main rear deflector shield.  One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.,Empire Strike Back
1098,HAN,Turn her around.,Empire Strike Back
1100,HAN,I said turn her around!  I'm going to put all power in the front shield.,Empire Strike Back
1101,LEIA,You're going to attack them?!,Empire Strike Back
1102,THREEPIO,Sir the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...,Empire Strike Back
1103,LEIA,Shut up!,Empire Strike Back
1108,NEEDA,They're moving to attack position!  Shields up!,Empire Strike Back
1110,NEEDA,Track them.  They may come around for another pass.,Empire Strike Back
1111,TRACKING OFFICER,Captain Needa the ship no longer appears on our scopes.,Empire Strike Back
1112,NEEDA,They can't have disappeared.  No ship that small has a cloaking device.,Empire Strike Back
1113,TRACKING OFFICER,Well there's no trace of them sir.,Empire Strike Back
1114,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,Captain Lord Vader demands an update on the pursuit.,Empire Strike Back
1115,NEEDA,Get a shuttle ready.  I shall assume full responsibility for losing them and apologize to Lord Vader. Meanwhile continue to scan the area.,Empire Strike Back
1116,COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER,Yes Captain Needa.,Empire Strike Back
1119,YODA,Use the Force.  Yes...,Empire Strike Back
1121,YODA,Now... the stone.  Feel it.,Empire Strike Back
1123,YODA,Concentrate!,Empire Strike Back
1126,LUKE,Oh no.  We'll never get it out now.,Empire Strike Back
1128,YODA,So certain are you.  Always with you it cannot be done.  Hear younothing that I say?,Empire Strike Back
1130,LUKE,Master moving stones around is one thing.  This is totally different.,Empire Strike Back
1131,YODA,No!  No different!  Only different in your mind.  You must unlearn what you have learned.,Empire Strike Back
1132,LUKE,All right I'll give it a try.,Empire Strike Back
1133,YODA,No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.  There is no try.,Empire Strike Back
1136,LUKE,I can't.  It's too big.,Empire Strike Back
1137,YODA,Size matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?  Hm?  Mmmm.,Empire Strike Back
1139,YODA,And well you should not.  For my ally in the Force.  And a powerful ally it is.  Life creates it makes it grow.  Its energy surrounds us and binds us.  Luminous beings are we...Here between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere!  Yes even between this land and that ship!,Empire Strike Back
1140,LUKE,You want the impossible.,Empire Strike Back
1145,LUKE,I don't... I don't believe it.,Empire Strike Back
1146,YODA,That is why you fail.,Empire Strike Back
1151,VADER,Apology accepted Captain Needa.,Empire Strike Back
1153,PIETT,Lord Vader our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.,Empire Strike Back
1154,VADER,Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory.,Empire Strike Back
1155,PIETT,Yes my lord.  We'll find them.,Empire Strike Back
1156,VADER,Don't fail me again Admiral.,Empire Strike Back
1158,PIETT,Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.,Empire Strike Back
1162,THREEPIO,Captain Solo this time you have gone too far.No I will not be quiet Chewbacca.Why doesn't anyone listen to me?,Empire Strike Back
1163,HAN,The fleet is beginning to break up.  Go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw.,Empire Strike Back
1165,THREEPIO,I really don't see how that is going to help.  Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances.  The Empire may be gracious enough...,Empire Strike Back
1167,HAN,Thank you.,Empire Strike Back
1168,LEIA,What did you have in mind for your next move?,Empire Strike Back
1169,HAN,Well if they follow standard Imperial procedure they'll dump their garbage before they go to light-speed then we just float away.,Empire Strike Back
1170,LEIA,With the rest of the garbage.Then what?,Empire Strike Back
1171,HAN,Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here.  Got any ideas?,Empire Strike Back
1172,LEIA,No.  Where are we?,Empire Strike Back
1173,HAN,The Anoat system.,Empire Strike Back
1174,LEIA,Anoat system.  There's not much there.,Empire Strike Back
1175,HAN,No.  Well wait.  This is interesting.  Lando.,Empire Strike Back
1177,LEIA,Lando system?,Empire Strike Back
1178,HAN,Lando's not a system he's a man.Lando Calrissian.  He's a card player gambler scoundrel.  You'd like him.,Empire Strike Back
1179,LEIA,Thanks.,Empire Strike Back
1180,HAN,Bespin.  It's pretty far but I think we can make it.,Empire Strike Back
1181,LEIA,A mining colony?,Empire Strike Back
1182,HAN,Yeah a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando conned somebody out of it.  We go back a long way Lando and me.,Empire Strike Back
1183,LEIA,Can you trust him?,Empire Strike Back
1184,HAN,No.  But he has no love for theEmpire I can tell you that.,Empire Strike Back
1186,HAN,Here we go Chewie.  Stand by.Detach!,Empire Strike Back
1188,LEIA,You do have your moments.  Not many but you have them.,Empire Strike Back
1193,YODA,Concentrate... feel the Force flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm yes.  Through the Force things you will see.  Other places.  The future... the past.  Old friends long gone.,Empire Strike Back
1195,LUKE,Han!  Leia!,Empire Strike Back
1197,YODA,Hmm.  Control control.  You must learn control.,Empire Strike Back
1198,LUKE,I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.,Empire Strike Back
1199,YODA,Mmm.  Friends you have there.,Empire Strike Back
1200,LUKE,They were in pain.,Empire Strike Back
1201,YODA,It is the future you see.,Empire Strike Back
1202,LUKE,Future?  Will they die?,Empire Strike Back
1204,YODA,Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future.,Empire Strike Back
1205,LUKE,I've got to go to them.,Empire Strike Back
1206,YODA,Decide you must how to serve them best.  If you leave now help them you could.  But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.,Empire Strike Back
1215,HAN,No I don't have a landing permit.  I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.,Empire Strike Back
1217,HAN,Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me explain.,Empire Strike Back
1218,INTERCOM VOICE,You will not deviate from your present course.,Empire Strike Back
1219,THREEPIO,Rather touchy aren't they?,Empire Strike Back
1220,LEIA,I thought you knew this person.,Empire Strike Back
1222,HAN,Well that was a long time ago.I'm sure he's forgotten about that.,Empire Strike Back
1223,INTERCOM VOICE,Permission granted to land on Platform Three-two-seven.,Empire Strike Back

1235,THREEPIO,Oh.  No one to meet us.,Empire Strike Back
1236,LEIA,I don't like this.,Empire Strike Back
1237,HAN,Well what would you like?,Empire Strike Back
1238,THREEPIO,Well they did let us land.,Empire Strike Back
1239,HAN,Look don't worry.  Everything's going to be fine.  Trust me.,Empire Strike Back

1275,HAN,Good.,Empire Strike Back
1277,LANDO,You know that ship saved my life quite a few times.  She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.,Empire Strike Back
1280,HAN,How's the gas mine?  Is it paying off for you?,Empire Strike Back
1281,LANDO,Oh not as well as I'd like.We're a small outpost and not very self-sufficient.  And I've had supply problems of every kind.I've had labor difficulties...What's so funny?,Empire Strike Back
1282,HAN,You.  Listen to you - you sound like a businessman a responsible leader.  Who'd have thought that huh?,Empire Strike Back
1284,LANDO,You know seeing you sure brings back a few things.,Empire Strike Back
1285,HAN,Yeah.,Empire Strike Back
1286,LANDO,Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.It's the price you pay for being successful.,Empire Strike Back
1289,THREEPIO,Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.,Empire Strike Back
1290,SECOND THREEPIO,E chu ta!,Empire Strike Back
1291,THREEPIO,How rude!,Empire Strike Back

1311,BEN,Even Yoda cannot see their fate.,Empire Strike Back
1312,LUKE,But I can help them!  I feel the Force!,Empire Strike Back
1313,BEN,But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.,Empire Strike Back
1314,YODA,Yes yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.The cave.  Remember your failure at the cave!,Empire Strike Back
1315,LUKE,But I've learned so much since then.  Master Yoda I promise to return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.,Empire Strike Back
1316,BEN,It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants.  that is why your friends are made to suffer.,Empire Strike Back
1317,LUKE,And that is why I have to go.,Empire Strike Back
1318,BEN,Luke I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.,Empire Strike Back
1319,LUKE,You won't.,Empire Strike Back
1320,YODA,Stopped they must be.  On this all depends.  Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor.  If you end your training now if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did you will become an agent of evil.,Empire Strike Back
1321,BEN,Patience.,Empire Strike Back
1322,LUKE,And sacrifice Han and Leia?,Empire Strike Back
1323,YODA,If you honor what they fight for... yes!,Empire Strike Back
1325,BEN,If you choose to face Vader you will do it alone.  I cannot interfere.,Empire Strike Back
1326,LUKE,I understand.Artoo fire up the converters.,Empire Strike Back
1328,BEN,Luke don't give in to hate - that leads to the dark side.,Empire Strike Back
1330,YODA,Strong is Vader.  Mind what you have learned.  Save you it can.,Empire Strike Back
1331,LUKE,I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.,Empire Strike Back
1333,YODA,Told you I did.  Reckless is he.  Now matters are worse.,Empire Strike Back
1334,BEN,That boy is our last hope.,Empire Strike Back
1335,YODA,No.  There is another.,Empire Strike Back
1340,HAN,The ship is almost finished.Two or Three more things and we're in great shape.,Empire Strike Back
1341,LEIA,The sooner the better.  Something's wrong here.  No one has seen or knows anything about Threepio.He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.,Empire Strike Back
1343,HAN,Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.,Empire Strike Back
1344,LEIA,I don't trust Lando.,Empire Strike Back
1345,HAN,Well I don't trust him either.But he is my friend.  Besides we'll soon be gone.,Empire Strike Back
1346,LEIA,And then you're as good as gone aren't you?,Empire Strike Back
1352,LEIA,What happened?,Empire Strike Back
1354,HAN,Where?  Found him in a junk pile?,Empire Strike Back
1355,LEIA,Oh what a mess.  Chewie do you think you can repair him?,Empire Strike Back
1357,HAN,Lando's got people who can fix him.,Empire Strike Back
1358,LEIA,No thanks.,Empire Strike Back
1360,LANDO,I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting anything?,Empire Strike Back
1361,LEIA,Not really.,Empire Strike Back
1362,LANDO,You look absolutely beautiful.You truly belong here with us among the clouds.,Empire Strike Back
1363,LEIA,Thank you.,Empire Strike Back
1364,LANDO,Will you join me for a little refreshment?,Empire Strike Back
1366,LANDO,Everyone's invited of course.,Empire Strike Back
1368,LANDO,Having trouble with you droid?,Empire Strike Back
1370,HAN,No.  No problem.  Why?,Empire Strike Back
1374,LANDO,So you see since we're a small operation we don't fall into the... uh... jurisdiction of the Empire.,Empire Strike Back
1375,LEIA,So you're part of the mining guild then?,Empire Strike Back
1376,LANDO,No not actually.  Our operation is small enough not to be noticed... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.,Empire Strike Back
1378,HAN,Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?,Empire Strike Back
1379,LANDO,That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here.  But things have developed that will insure security.I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out of here forever.,Empire Strike Back
1383,VADER,We would be honored if you would join us.,Empire Strike Back
1385,LANDO,I had no choice.  They arrived right before you did.  I'm sorry.HANI'm sorry too.,Empire Strike Back
1390,LUKE,No Threepio's with them.,Empire Strike Back
1392,LUKE,Just hang on.  We're almost there.,Empire Strike Back
1396,THREEPIO,Mmmm.  Oh my.  Uh I uh - Take this off!  I uh don't mean to intrude here.  I don't no no no... Please don't get up.  No!,Empire Strike Back
1398,THREEPIO,Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in danger.  I must tell the others.Oh no!  I've been shot!,Empire Strike Back
1403,LANDO,Lord Vader.,Empire Strike Back
1404,VADER,You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I have Skywalker.,Empire Strike Back
1406,BOBA FETT,He's no good to me dead.,Empire Strike Back
1407,VADER,He will not be permanently damaged.,Empire Strike Back
1408,LANDO,Lord Vader what about Leia and the Wookiee?,Empire Strike Back
1409,VADER,They must never again leave this city.,Empire Strike Back
1410,LANDO,That was never a condition of our agreement nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!,Empire Strike Back
1411,VADER,Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.,Empire Strike Back
1412,LANDO,No.,Empire Strike Back
1413,VADER,Good.  It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison here.,Empire Strike Back
1415,LANDO,This deal's getting worse all the time.,Empire Strike Back
1418,THREEPIO,Oh yes that's very good.  I like that.  Oh!  Something's not right because now I can't see.  Wait.  Wait!  Oh my!  what have you done?  I'm backwards you stupid furball.  Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...,Empire Strike Back
1420,HAN,I feel terrible.,Empire Strike Back
1422,LEIA,Why are they doing this?,Empire Strike Back
1423,HAN,They never even asked me any questions.,Empire Strike Back
1425,LEIA,Lando.,Empire Strike Back
1426,HAN,Get out of here Lando!,Empire Strike Back
1427,LANDO,Shut up and listen!  Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.,Empire Strike Back
1428,HAN,Over to you?,Empire Strike Back
1429,LANDO,They'll have to stay here but at least they'll be safe.,Empire Strike Back
1430,LEIA,What about Han?,Empire Strike Back
1431,LANDO,Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.,Empire Strike Back
1432,LEIA,Vader wants us all dead.,Empire Strike Back
1433,LANDO,He doesn't want you at all.  He's after somebody called Skywalker.,Empire Strike Back
1434,HAN,Luke?,Empire Strike Back
1435,LANDO,Lord Vader has set a trap for him.,Empire Strike Back
1437,LEIA,And we're the bait.,Empire Strike Back
1438,LANDO,Well he's on his way.,Empire Strike Back
1440,HAN,Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty good didn't you?My friend!,Empire Strike Back
1442,LANDO,Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm sorry I couldn't do better but I have my own problems.,Empire Strike Back
1443,HAN,Yeah you're a real hero.,Empire Strike Back
1445,LEIA,You certainly have a way with people.,Empire Strike Back
1448,VADER,This facility is crude but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.,Empire Strike Back
1450,IMPERIAL SOLDIER,Lord Vader ship approaching.X-wing class.,Empire Strike Back
1451,VADER,Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.,Empire Strike Back
1453,LANDO,Lord Vader we only use this facility for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there it might kill him.,Empire Strike Back
1454,VADER,I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged.  We will test it... on Captain Solo.,Empire Strike Back
1462,THREEPIO,If only you had attached my legs I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position.  Now remember Chewbacca you have a responsibility to me so don't do anything foolish.,Empire Strike Back
1463,HAN,What's going on... buddy?,Empire Strike Back
1464,LANDO,You're being put into carbon freeze.,Empire Strike Back
1466,BOBA FETT,What if he doesn't survive?  He's worth a lot to me.,Empire Strike Back
1467,VADER,The Empire will compensate you if he dies.  Put him in!,Empire Strike Back
1470,THREEPIO,Oh no!  No no no!  Stop Chewbacca stop...!,Empire Strike Back
1472,HAN,Stop Chewie stop!  Do you hear me?  Stop!,Empire Strike Back
1473,THREEPIO,Yes stop please!  I'm not ready to die.,Empire Strike Back
1475,HAN,Chewie!  Chewie this won't help me.  Hey!,Empire Strike Back
1477,HAN,Save your strength.  There'll be another time.  The princess - you have to take care of her.  You hear me?,Empire Strike Back
1480,LEIA,I love you!,Empire Strike Back
1481,HAN,I know.,Empire Strike Back
1485,THREEPIO,What... what's going on?  Turn round Chewbacca I can't see.  Oh... they've encased him in carbonite.  He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process that is.,Empire Strike Back
1488,VADER,Well Calrissian did he survive?,Empire Strike Back
1489,LANDO,Yes he's alive.  And in perfect hibernation.,Empire Strike Back
1491,VADER,He's all yours bounty hunter.Reset the chamber for Skywalker.,Empire Strike Back
1492,IMPERIAL OFFICER,Skywalker has just landed my lord.,Empire Strike Back
1493,VADER,Good.  See to it that he finds his way here.  Calrissian take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.,Empire Strike Back
1494,LANDO,You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.,Empire Strike Back
1495,VADER,I am altering the deal.  Pray I don't alter it any further.,Empire Strike Back
1501,LEIA,Luke!  Luke don't - it's a trap!  It's a trap!,Empire Strike Back
1512,VADER,The Force is with you young Skywalker.  But you are not a Jedi yet.,Empire Strike Back
1517,LANDO,Well done.  Hold them in the security tower - and keep it quiet.  Move.,Empire Strike Back
1519,LEIA,What do you think you're doing?,Empire Strike Back
1520,LANDO,We're getting out of here.,Empire Strike Back
1521,THREEPIO,I knew all along it had to be a mistake.,Empire Strike Back
1523,LEIA,Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust you?,Empire Strike Back
1525,LANDO,I had no choice...,Empire Strike Back
1527,THREEPIO,What are you doing?  Trust him trust him!,Empire Strike Back
1528,LEIA,Oh so we understand don't we Chewie?  He had no choice.,Empire Strike Back
1529,LANDO,I'm just trying to help...,Empire Strike Back
1530,LEIA,We don't need any of your help.,Empire Strike Back
1531,LANDO,H-a-a-a...,Empire Strike Back
1532,LEIA,What?,Empire Strike Back
1533,THREEPIO,It sounds like Han.,Empire Strike Back
1534,LANDO,There's still a chance to save Han... I mean at the East Platform...,Empire Strike Back
1535,LEIA,Chewie.,Empire Strike Back
1537,THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all he's only a Wookiee.,Empire Strike Back
1540,BOBA FETT,Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.,Empire Strike Back
1544,THREEPIO,Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you been?,Empire Strike Back
1546,THREEPIO,Turn around you wooly...! Hurry hurry!  We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!,Empire Strike Back
1548,THREEPIO,Well at least your still in one piece!  Look what happened to me!,Empire Strike Back
1553,THREEPIO,Oh no!  Chewie they're behind you!,Empire Strike Back
1559,VADER,You have learned much young one.,Empire Strike Back
1560,LUKE,You'll find I'm full of surprises.,Empire Strike Back
1562,VADER,Your destiny lies with me Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to be true.,Empire Strike Back
1563,LUKE,No!,Empire Strike Back
1566,VADER,All to easy.  Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor thought.,Empire Strike Back
1569,VADER,Impressive... most impressive.,Empire Strike Back
1571,VADER,Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You have controlled your fear... now release your anger.,Empire Strike Back
1573,VADER,Only your hatred can destroy me.,Empire Strike Back
1586,LANDO,The security codes has been changed!,Empire Strike Back
1587,THREEPIO,Artoo you can tell the computer to override the security system.,Empire Strike Back
1589,LANDO,Attention!  This is LandoCalrissian.  The Empire has takes control of the city.  I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial troops arrive.,Empire Strike Back
1591,LANDO,This way.,Empire Strike Back
1593,THREEPIO,Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.,Empire Strike Back
1597,THREEPIO,What are you talking about?  We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon.  It's fixed!  Just open the door you stupid lump.,Empire Strike Back
1599,THREEPIO,I never doubted you for a second.Wonderful!,Empire Strike Back
1603,THREEPIO,Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend down you thoughtless... Ow!,Empire Strike Back
1605,LANDO,Leia!  Go!,Empire Strike Back
1608,THREEPIO,I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me.  Of course I've looked better.,Empire Strike Back
1617,VADER,You are beaten.  It is useless to resist.  Don't let yourself be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.,Empire Strike Back
1621,VADER,There is no escape.  Don't make me destroy you.  You do not yet realize your importance.  You have only begun to discover your power.  Join me and I will complete your training.  With our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.,Empire Strike Back
1622,LUKE,I'll never join you!,Empire Strike Back
1623,VADER,If you only knew the power of the dark side.  Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father.,Empire Strike Back
1624,LUKE,He told me enough!  It was you who killed him.,Empire Strike Back
