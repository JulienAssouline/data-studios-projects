15,SHUTTLE CAPTAIN,We're starting our approach.,Return of the Jedi
19,OFFICER,Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.,Return of the Jedi
20,OPERATOR,Yes sir.,Return of the Jedi
25,JERJERROD,Lord Vader this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence.,Return of the Jedi
26,VADER,You may dispense with the pleasantries Commander. I'm here to put you back onschedule.,Return of the Jedi
28,JERJERROD,I assure you Lord Vader my men are working as fast as they can.,Return of the Jedi
29,VADER,Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.,Return of the Jedi
30,JERJERROD,I tell you this station will be operational as planned.,Return of the Jedi
31,VADER,The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.,Return of the Jedi
32,JERJERROD,But he asks the impossible. I need more men.,Return of the Jedi
33,VADER,Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.,Return of the Jedi
35,VADER,That is correct Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.,Return of the Jedi
36,JERJERROD,We shall double our efforts.,Return of the Jedi
37,VADER,I hope so Commander for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.,Return of the Jedi
40,THREEPIO,Of course I'm worried. And you should be too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.,Return of the Jedi
42,THREEPIO,Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt you'd probably short-circuit.,Return of the Jedi
44,THREEPIO,Artoo are you sure this is the right place? I better knock I suppose.,Return of the Jedi
49,STRANGE VOICE,Tee chuta hhat yudd!,Return of the Jedi

69,BIB,Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.,Return of the Jedi
71,THREEPIO,He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.,Return of the Jedi
73,THREEPIO,I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.,Return of the Jedi
75,BIB,Nudd Chaa.,Return of the Jedi
77,THREEPIO,Artoo I have a bad feeling about this.,Return of the Jedi
80,THREEPIO,Good morning.,Return of the Jedi
81,JABBA,Bo Shuda!,Return of the Jedi
83,THREEPIO,The message Artoo the message.,Return of the Jedi
85,LUKE,Greetings Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful mighty Jabba and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill I present to you a gift: these two droids.,Return of the Jedi
87,THREEPIO,What did he say?,Return of the Jedi
89,THREEPIO,This can't be! Artoo you're playing the wrong message.,Return of the Jedi
93,THREEPIO,We're doomed.,Return of the Jedi
96,THREEPIO,Artoo look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.,Return of the Jedi
99,THREEPIO,What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!,Return of the Jedi
103,NINEDENINE,Ah good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid are you not?,Return of the Jedi
104,THREEPIO,I am See-Threepio human-cy...,Return of the Jedi

107,NINEDENINE,How many languages do you speak?,Return of the Jedi
108,THREEPIO,I am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily...,Return of the Jedi
109,NINEDENINE,Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.,Return of the Jedi
110,THREEPIO,Disintegrated?,Return of the Jedi
115,NINEDENINE,You're a feisty little one but you'll soon learn some respect. I have need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in nicely.,Return of the Jedi

134,THREEPIO,Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.,Return of the Jedi
137,THREEPIO,Uh oh... but what what did I say?(to Boushh)Uh the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.,Return of the Jedi
139,THREEPIO,Because he's holding a thermal detonator.,Return of the Jedi
143,THREEPIO,Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.,Return of the Jedi
145,BOUSHH,Zeebuss.,Return of the Jedi
146,THREEPIO,He agrees!,Return of the Jedi
159,BOUSHH,Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.,Return of the Jedi

172,HAN,What's that? I know that laugh.,Return of the Jedi
174,HAN,Hey Jabba. Look Jabba I was just on my way to pay you back but I got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.,Return of the Jedi
177,HAN,Look...,Return of the Jedi
180,HAN,Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!,Return of the Jedi
184,LEIA,We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...,Return of the Jedi
187,LEIA,Ugh!,Return of the Jedi
188,THREEPIO,Ohhh I can't bear to watch.,Return of the Jedi
191,HAN,Chewie? Chewie is that you?,Return of the Jedi
193,HAN,Ah! Chew--Chewie!,Return of the Jedi
195,HAN,Wait. I can't see pal. What's goin' on?,Return of the Jedi
197,HAN,Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself much less rescue anybody.,Return of the Jedi
199,HAN,A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while everybody gets delusions of grandeur.,Return of the Jedi
201,HAN,I'm all right pal. I'm all right.,Return of the Jedi
206,LUKE,I must speak with Jabba.,Return of the Jedi
208,LUKE,You will take me to Jabba now!,Return of the Jedi
210,LUKE,You serve your master well.,Return of the Jedi
212,LUKE,And you will be rewarded.,Return of the Jedi
215,THREEPIO,At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.,Return of the Jedi
216,BIB,Master.,Return of the Jedi
218,BIB,...Luke Skywalker Jedi Knight.,Return of the Jedi
220,LUKE,I must be allowed to speak.,Return of the Jedi
225,LUKE,You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.,Return of the Jedi
227,LUKE,Nevertheless I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers.,Return of the Jedi
229,THREEPIO,Master Luke you're standing on...,Return of the Jedi
232,JABBA,Bascka!,Return of the Jedi
236,THREEPIO,Oh no! The Rancor!,Return of the Jedi
250,LUKE,Han!,Return of the Jedi
251,HAN,Luke!,Return of the Jedi
252,LUKE,Are you all right?,Return of the Jedi
253,HAN,Fine. Together again huh?,Return of the Jedi
254,LUKE,Wouldn't miss it.,Return of the Jedi
255,HAN,How are we doing?,Return of the Jedi
256,LUKE,The same as always.,Return of the Jedi
257,HAN,That bad huh? Where's Leia?,Return of the Jedi
259,LEIA,I'm here.,Return of the Jedi
262,THREEPIO,Oh dear. His High Exaltedness the great Jabba the Hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.,Return of the Jedi
263,HAN,Good I hate long waits.,Return of the Jedi
264,THREEPIO,You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.,Return of the Jedi
266,THREEPIO,In his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.,Return of the Jedi
267,HAN,On second thought let's pass on that huh?,Return of the Jedi
269,LUKE,You should have bargained Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever make.,Return of the Jedi
274,HAN,I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur I see a big light blur.,Return of the Jedi
275,LUKE,There's nothing to see. I used to live here you know.,Return of the Jedi
276,HAN,You're gonna die here you know. Convenient.,Return of the Jedi
277,LUKE,Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.,Return of the Jedi
278,HAN,Oh... great!,Return of the Jedi
283,THREEPIO,Oh I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?,Return of the Jedi
285,THREEPIO,Well I can see you're serving drinks but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and if we're not careful us too!,Return of the Jedi
287,THREEPIO,Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.,Return of the Jedi
292,THREEPIO,Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.,Return of the Jedi
295,HAN,Threepio you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right?,Return of the Jedi
297,LUKE,Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.,Return of the Jedi
315,LUKE,Easy Chewie.,Return of the Jedi
317,LANDO,Whoa! Whoa! Help!,Return of the Jedi
323,HAN,Chewie you okay? Where is he?,Return of the Jedi
325,HAN,I'm okay pal.,Return of the Jedi
328,LANDO,Han! Chewie?,Return of the Jedi
329,HAN,Lando!,Return of the Jedi
334,HAN,Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?,Return of the Jedi
341,HAN,Lando grab it!,Return of the Jedi
342,LANDO,Lower it!,Return of the Jedi
343,HAN,I'm trying!,Return of the Jedi
345,HAN,Whoa! Whoa! Grab me Chewie! I'm slipping.,Return of the Jedi
347,HAN,Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!,Return of the Jedi
350,HAN,Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!,Return of the Jedi
352,LANDO,Hold it! Whoa!,Return of the Jedi
354,HAN,Gently now. All... all right. Now easy easy. Hold me Chewie.,Return of the Jedi
356,HAN,Chewie! Chewie give me the gun. Don't move Lando.,Return of the Jedi
357,LANDO,No wait! I thought you were blind!,Return of the Jedi
358,HAN,It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.,Return of the Jedi
359,LANDO,All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!,Return of the Jedi
361,HAN,Chewie Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up Chewie up!,Return of the Jedi
366,LEIA,Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.,Return of the Jedi
368,THREEPIO,Not my eyes! Artoo help! Quickly Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!,Return of the Jedi
374,LUKE,Point it at the deck!,Return of the Jedi
377,THREEPIO,Artoo where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.,Return of the Jedi
380,LUKE,Come on!,Return of the Jedi
384,LUKE,Let's go! And don't forget the droids.,Return of the Jedi
385,LANDO,We're on our way.,Return of the Jedi
394,HAN,I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!,Return of the Jedi
395,LEIA,That's all any of us can see.,Return of the Jedi
400,HAN,No I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing!,Return of the Jedi
403,HAN,Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?,Return of the Jedi
404,LUKE,I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.,Return of the Jedi
407,LANDO,Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.,Return of the Jedi
408,LEIA,"He means ""You're welcome.""",Return of the Jedi
409,LANDO,Come on let's get off this miserable dust ball.,Return of the Jedi
414,LUKE,I'll meet you back at the fleet.,Return of the Jedi
416,LUKE,I will.,Return of the Jedi
419,LUKE,That's right Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend.,Return of the Jedi
430,VADER,The Death Star will be completed on schedule.,Return of the Jedi
431,EMPEROR,You have done well Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.,Return of the Jedi
432,VADER,Yes my Master.,Return of the Jedi
433,EMPEROR,Patience my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does you must bring himbefore me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of theForce.,Return of the Jedi
434,VADER,As you wish.,Return of the Jedi
435,EMPEROR,Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.,Return of the Jedi
441,YODA,Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?,Return of the Jedi
443,LUKE,No... of course not.,Return of the Jedi
446,YODA,Soon will I rest. Yes forever sleep. Earned it I have.,Return of the Jedi
448,LUKE,Master Yoda you can't die.,Return of the Jedi
449,YODA,Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.,Return of the Jedi
450,LUKE,But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.,Return of the Jedi
451,YODA,No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.,Return of the Jedi
453,LUKE,Then I am a Jedi?,Return of the Jedi
456,LUKE,Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?,Return of the Jedi
458,YODA,Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.,Return of the Jedi
460,LUKE,Yoda I must know.,Return of the Jedi
461,YODA,Your father he is.,Return of the Jedi
463,YODA,Told you did he?,Return of the Jedi
464,LUKE,Yes.,Return of the Jedi
466,YODA,Unexpected this is and unfortunate...,Return of the Jedi
467,LUKE,Unfortunate that I know the truth?,Return of the Jedi
470,LUKE,Well I'm sorry.,Return of the Jedi
471,YODA,Remember a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger fear aggression.The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate yourdestiny.,Return of the Jedi
473,YODA,Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your father's fate you will. Luke when gone am I(cough)the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned Luke... (with great effort)There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.,Return of the Jedi
477,LUKE,I can't do it Artoo. I can't go on alone.,Return of the Jedi
480,LUKE,Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?,Return of the Jedi
482,LUKE,You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.,Return of the Jedi
483,BEN,You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalkerand became Darth Vader. When that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view.,Return of the Jedi
485,BEN,Luke you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our ownpoint of view.,Return of the Jedi
487,BEN,I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see what happened to your father was my fault.,Return of the Jedi
489,BEN,Anakin was a good friend.,Return of the Jedi
491,BEN,When I first knew him your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy.,Return of the Jedi
493,LUKE,There's still good in him.,Return of the Jedi
494,BEN,I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.,Return of the Jedi
495,LUKE,I can't do it Ben.,Return of the Jedi
496,BEN,You cannot escape your destiny.,Return of the Jedi
497,LUKE,I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.,Return of the Jedi
498,BEN,Vader humbled you when first you met him Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you among other things the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.,Return of the Jedi
499,LUKE,But I had to help my friends.,Return of the Jedi
502,BEN,To be a Jedi Luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you like your father. Only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now Luke. You are strong and patient. And now you must face Darth Vader again!,Return of the Jedi
503,LUKE,I can't kill my own father.,Return of the Jedi
504,BEN,Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.,Return of the Jedi
505,LUKE,Yoda spoke of another.,Return of the Jedi
506,BEN,The other he spoke of is your twin sister.,Return of the Jedi
507,LUKE,But I have no sister.,Return of the Jedi
508,BEN,Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew as I did if Anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.,Return of the Jedi
509,LUKE,Leia! Leia's my sister.,Return of the Jedi
510,BEN,Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down Luke. They do you credit.But they could be made to serve the Emperor.,Return of the Jedi
516,LUKE,But you can't let her get involved now Ben. Vader will destroy her.,Return of the Jedi
517,BEN,She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have Luke... but the Force is strong with her as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!,Return of the Jedi
524,HAN,Well look at you a general huh?,Return of the Jedi
525, LANDO, Oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.,Return of the Jedi
528,HAN,Well who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable one remember?,Return of the Jedi
530,MON MOTHMA,The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come.,Return of the Jedi
532,MON MOTHMA,The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it is relatively unprotected. But most important of all we've learned that the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this Death Star.,Return of the Jedi
536,ACKBAR,You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weaponsystems on this Death Star are not yet operational the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.,Return of the Jedi
540,HAN,Good luck.,Return of the Jedi
542,HAN,You're gonna need it.,Return of the Jedi
543,ACKBAR,General Madine.,Return of the Jedi
545,GENERAL MADINE,We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship and using a secretImperial code a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator.,Return of the Jedi
547,THREEPIO,Sounds dangerous.,Return of the Jedi
549,GENERAL MADINE,General Solo is your strike team assembled?,Return of the Jedi
551,HAN,Uh my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.,Return of the Jedi
553,HAN,Well it's gonna be rough pal. I didn't want to speak for you.,Return of the Jedi
556,LEIA,Uh General... count me in.,Return of the Jedi
560,LEIA, What is it?,Return of the Jedi
563,HAN,Luke.,Return of the Jedi
564,LUKE,Hi Han... Chewie.,Return of the Jedi
566, THREEPIO,"""Exciting"" is hardly the word I would use.",Return of the Jedi
569,HAN,Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She'sthe fastest ship in the fleet.,Return of the Jedi
570,LANDO,All right old buddy. You know I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her.She-she won't get a scratch. All right?,Return of the Jedi
572,LANDO,Look would you get going you pirate.,Return of the Jedi
574,LANDO,Good luck.,Return of the Jedi
575,HAN,You too.,Return of the Jedi
579,HAN,You got her warmed?,Return of the Jedi
580,LUKE,Yeah she's comin' up.,Return of the Jedi
582,HAN,No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed her Chewie.,Return of the Jedi
585,LEIA,Hey are you awake?,Return of the Jedi
586,HAN,Yeah I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.,Return of the Jedi
590,HAN,Right. Chewie let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready everybody?,Return of the Jedi
591,LUKE,All set.,Return of the Jedi
592,THREEPIO,Here we go again.,Return of the Jedi
593,HAN,All right hang on.,Return of the Jedi
599,VADER,What is thy bidding my Master?,Return of the Jedi
600,EMPEROR,Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until called for.,Return of the Jedi
601,VADER,What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?,Return of the Jedi
602,EMPEROR,It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.,Return of the Jedi
603,VADER,Yes my Master.,Return of the Jedi
609,HAN,If they don't go for this we're gonna have to get outta here pretty quick Chewie.,Return of the Jedi
612,HAN,Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.,Return of the Jedi
614,HAN,Transmission commencing.,Return of the Jedi
616,LEIA,Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.,Return of the Jedi
617,HAN,It'll work. It'll work.,Return of the Jedi
619,LUKE,Vader's on that ship.,Return of the Jedi
620,HAN,Now don't get jittery Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though Chewie but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.,Return of the Jedi
622,HAN,I don't know.  Fly casual.,Return of the Jedi
623,LUKE,I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.,Return of the Jedi
624,HAN,It's your imagination kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.,Return of the Jedi
628,VADER,Where is that shuttle going?,Return of the Jedi
632,VADER,Do they have a code clearance?,Return of the Jedi
633,PIETT,It's an older code sir but it checks out. I was about to clear them.,Return of the Jedi
635,PIETT,Shall I hold them?,Return of the Jedi
636,VADER,No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.,Return of the Jedi
641,HAN,They're not goin' for it Chewie.,Return of the Jedi
644,HAN,Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.,Return of the Jedi
651,THREEPIO,Oh I told you it was dangerous here.,Return of the Jedi
653,LEIA,Shall we try and go around?,Return of the Jedi
654,HAN,It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.,Return of the Jedi
658,HAN,Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.,Return of the Jedi
659,LUKE,Quietly there might be more of them out there.,Return of the Jedi
667,LEIA,Over there! Two more of them!,Return of the Jedi
668,LUKE,I see them. Wait Leia!,Return of the Jedi
672,HAN,Hey wait! Ahhh!,Return of the Jedi
676,LUKE,Move closer!,Return of the Jedi
678,LUKE,Get alongside that one!,Return of the Jedi
680,LUKE,Get him!,Return of the Jedi
693,THREEPIO,Oh General Solo somebody's coming. Oh!,Return of the Jedi
696,HAN,Luke! Where's Leia?,Return of the Jedi
698,HAN,I thought she was with you.,Return of the Jedi
699,LUKE,We got separated.,Return of the Jedi
701,LUKE,Hey we better go look for her.,Return of the Jedi
703,HAN,Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at ,Return of the Jedi
704,LUKE,Come on Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.,Return of the Jedi

745,VADER,A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.,Return of the Jedi
749,VADER,I have felt him my Master.,Return of the Jedi
750,EMPEROR,Strange that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear LordVader.,Return of the Jedi
752,VADER,They are clear my Master.,Return of the Jedi
753,EMPEROR,Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.,Return of the Jedi
755,EMPEROR,I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you andthen you will bring him before me.,Return of the Jedi
762,THREEPIO,Oh Master Luke.,Return of the Jedi
763,LUKE,There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.,Return of the Jedi

780,HAN,Yeah sure.,Return of the Jedi
782,THREEPIO,Artoo I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!,Return of the Jedi

795,HAN,What are you telling them?,Return of the Jedi
796,THREEPIO,Hello I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  ButI do believe they think I am some sort of god.,Return of the Jedi
798,HAN,Well why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?,Return of the Jedi
799,THREEPIO,I beg your pardon General Solo but that just wouldn't be proper.,Return of the Jedi
800,HAN,Proper?!,Return of the Jedi

828,HAN,Somehow I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.,Return of the Jedi
829,LUKE,Threepio tell them if they don't do as you wish you'll become angry and use your magic.,Return of the Jedi
830,THREEPIO,But Master Luke what magic? I couldn't possibly --,Return of the Jedi

864,LEIA,Luke what's wrong?,Return of the Jedi
866,LUKE,Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?,Return of the Jedi

881,LUKE,He's my father.,Return of the Jedi
882,LEIA,Your father?,Return of the Jedi
883,LUKE,There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it but you must. If I don't make it back you're the only hope for the Alliance.,Return of the Jedi
885,LEIA,Luke don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.,Return of the Jedi
886,LUKE,You're wrong Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.,Return of the Jedi
888,LUKE,Yes. It's you Leia.,Return of the Jedi
889,LEIA,I know. Somehow...I've always known.,Return of the Jedi
890,LUKE,Then you know why I have to face him.,Return of the Jedi
891,LEIA,No! Luke run away far away. If he can feel your presence then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.,Return of the Jedi
892,LUKE,No you don't. You've always been strong.,Return of the Jedi
893,LEIA,But why must you confront him?,Return of the Jedi
894,LUKE,Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.,Return of the Jedi
897,HAN,Hey what's goin' on?,Return of the Jedi
899,LEIA,Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.,Return of the Jedi
902,LEIA,I...I can't tell you.,Return of the Jedi

925,LURE,I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker my father.,Return of the Jedi
927,LUKE,It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your Emperor now.,Return of the Jedi
931,VADER,Your skills are complete. Indeed you are powerful as the Emperor has foreseen.,Return of the Jedi
933,LUKE,Come with me.,Return of the Jedi
934,VADER,Obi-Wan once thought as you do.,Return of the Jedi
936,VADER,You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.,Return of the Jedi
937,LUKE,I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.,Return of the Jedi
938,VADER,If that is your destiny.,Return of the Jedi
939,LUKE,Search your feelings father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate.,Return of the Jedi
940,VADER,It is too late for me son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He isyour master now.,Return of the Jedi
942,LUKE,Then my father is truly dead.,Return of the Jedi
945,LEIA,The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that landing platform. Thisisn't gonna be easy.,Return of the Jedi
946,HAN,Hey don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this.,Return of the Jedi
948,LEIA,What's he saying?,Return of the Jedi
949,THREEPIO,He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.,Return of the Jedi
954,LANDO,Admiral we're in position. All fighters accounted for.,Return of the Jedi

975,THREEPIO,I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.,Return of the Jedi
976,LEIA,Oh no.,Return of the Jedi
984,SCOUT,Look! Over there! Stop him!,Return of the Jedi
988,HAN,Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here. We'll take care of this.,Return of the Jedi

997,EMPEROR,Welcome young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.,Return of the Jedi
999,EMPEROR,You no longer need those.,Return of the Jedi
1001,EMPEROR,Guards leave us.,Return of the Jedi
1004,LUKE,You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.,Return of the Jedi
1006,EMPEROR,Oh no my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.,Return of the Jedi
1007,VADER,His lightsaber.,Return of the Jedi
1009,EMPEROR,Ah yes a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with you.,Return of the Jedi
1010,LUKE,You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.,Return of the Jedi
1012,EMPEROR,Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.,Return of the Jedi
1014,EMPEROR,Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.,Return of the Jedi
1016,LUKE,Your overconfidence is your weakness.,Return of the Jedi
