561,OBI-WAN, Sorry old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor carrying me unconscious on your back and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .,Revenge of the Sith
562,ANAKIN, All because of your training Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.,Revenge of the Sith
563,OBI-WAN, . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin let's be fair. Today you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.,Revenge of the Sith

567,MACE WlNDU, Chancellor Palpatine what a welcome sight! Are you all right?,Revenge of the Sith
568,PALPATINE, Yes thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku but General Grievous has escaped once again.,Revenge of the Sith
569,MACE WlNDU, General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.,Revenge of the Sith
570,PALPATINE, That maybe true but with Count Dooku dead he is the leader of the Droid Army and I assure you the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.,Revenge of the Sith
571,MACE WlNDU, Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.,Revenge of the Sith
573,BAIL ORGANA, Skywalker the Republic cannot praise you enough.,Revenge of the Sith
575,ANAKIN, Thank you Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.,Revenge of the Sith

579,C-3PO,  Well there I agree with you. In fact I could do with a tune-up myself.,Revenge of the Sith
582,BAIL ORGANA, The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.,Revenge of the Sith
583,ANAKIN, I wish that were so but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.,Revenge of the Sith
585,BAIL ORGANA, I'll do everything I can with the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith

592,ANAKIN, I'm back I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.,Revenge of the Sith
594,PADME, Wait not here . . .,Revenge of the Sith
596,ANAKIN, Yes here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.,Revenge of the Sith

598,ANAKIN, I've given my life to the Jedi order but I'd only give up my life for you.,Revenge of the Sith
599,PADME,  I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.,Revenge of the Sith

603,ANAKIN, That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?,Revenge of the Sith
604,PADME, Nothing . . . nothing . . .,Revenge of the Sith
605,ANAKIN, You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!,Revenge of the Sith
607,PADME, You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .,Revenge of the Sith
608,ANAKIN, . . . Is there someone else?,Revenge of the Sith
609,PADME,  No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much Anakin. I do nothing to betray you yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.,Revenge of the Sith
610,ANAKIN,  I'm afraid of losing you Padme . . . that's all.,Revenge of the Sith
611,PADME, I will never stop loving you Anakin. My only fear is losing you.,Revenge of the Sith
612,ANAKIN, It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .,Revenge of the Sith
613,PADME, Something wonderful has happened.,Revenge of the Sith
615,PADME,  I'm . . . Annie I'm pregnant.,Revenge of the Sith
617,ANAKIN, That's . . . that's wonderful.,Revenge of the Sith
618,PADME, What are we going to do?,Revenge of the Sith
619,ANAKIN, We're not going to worry about anything right now all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.,Revenge of the Sith
622,SUPER BATTLE DROID G21, The planet is secure sir. The population is under control.,Revenge of the Sith
623,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Good. Where is the Separatist Council?,Revenge of the Sith
624,SUPER BATTLE DROID G21, This way sir ...,Revenge of the Sith
628,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Yes Lord Sidious.,Revenge of the Sith
629,DARTH SlDIOUS, General Grievous I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.,Revenge of the Sith
630,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, It will be done My Lord.,Revenge of the Sith
631,DARTH SlDIOUS, The end of the war is near General and I promise you victory is assured.,Revenge of the Sith
633,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, But the loss of Count Dooku?,Revenge of the Sith
634,DARTH SlDIOUS, His death was a necessary loss which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.,Revenge of the Sith
637,ANAKIN, . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.,Revenge of the Sith
638,PADME, Annie I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot right by the gardens.,Revenge of the Sith
639,ANAKIN, You are so beautiful!,Revenge of the Sith
640,PADME, It's only because I'm so in love . . .,Revenge of the Sith
641,ANAKIN, No it's because I'm so in love with you.,Revenge of the Sith
642,PADME, So love has blinded you?,Revenge of the Sith
643,ANAKIN, Well that's not exactly what I meant . . .,Revenge of the Sith
644,PADME, But it's probably true!,Revenge of the Sith
646,ANAKIN, I haven't laughed in so long . . .,Revenge of the Sith
647,PADME, Neither have I.,Revenge of the Sith
650,PADME, Anakin help me! Help Anakin! Anakin I love you. I love you.,Revenge of the Sith
654,PADME, Anakin??,Revenge of the Sith
658,PADME, What's bothering you?,Revenge of the Sith
659,ANAKIN, Nothing . . .,Revenge of the Sith
661,ANAKIN,  I remember when I gave this to you.,Revenge of the Sith
662,PADME, Anakin how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?,Revenge of the Sith
663,ANAKIN, It was a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
664,PADME, Bad?,Revenge of the Sith
665,ANAKIN, Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.,Revenge of the Sith
666,PADME, And?,Revenge of the Sith
667,ANAKIN, It was about you.,Revenge of the Sith
669,PADME, Tell me.,Revenge of the Sith
670,ANAKIN, It was only a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
672,ANAKIN,  You die in childbirth . . .,Revenge of the Sith
673,PADME, And the baby?,Revenge of the Sith
674,ANAKIN, I don't know.,Revenge of the Sith
675,PADME, It was only a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
677,ANAKIN, . . . I won't let this one become real Padme.,Revenge of the Sith
679,PADME, Anakin this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate and if the Council discovers you are the father you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.,Revenge of the Sith
680,ANAKIN, I know .,Revenge of the Sith
681,PADME, Anakin do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?,Revenge of the Sith
682,ANAKIN,  Have you told him anything?,Revenge of the Sith
683,PADME, No but he's your mentor your best friend . . . he must suspect something.,Revenge of the Sith
684,ANAKIN, He's been a father to me but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!,Revenge of the Sith
685,PADME, I won't Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith
686,ANAKIN, I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing not a problem.,Revenge of the Sith
689,YODA, Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .,Revenge of the Sith
690,ANAKIN, They are of pain suffering death . . .,Revenge of the Sith
691,YODA, Yourself you speak of or someone you know?,Revenge of the Sith
692,ANAKIN, Someone . . .,Revenge of the Sith
693,YODA, . . . close to you?,Revenge of the Sith
694,ANAKIN, Yes.,Revenge of the Sith
695,YODA, Careful you must be when sensing the future Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.,Revenge of the Sith
696,ANAKIN, I won't let these visions come true Master Yoda.,Revenge of the Sith
697,YODA, Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.,Revenge of the Sith
698,ANAKIN, What must I do Master Yoda?,Revenge of the Sith
699,YODA, Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.,Revenge of the Sith
704,OBI-WAN, You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.,Revenge of the Sith
705,ANAKIN, I'm sorry I was held up. I have no excuse.,Revenge of the Sith
706,OBI-WAN, In short they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.,Revenge of the Sith
707,ANAKIN, What's wrong then?,Revenge of the Sith
708,OBI-WAN, The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.,Revenge of the Sith
709,ANAKIN, Well that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.,Revenge of the Sith
710,OBI-WAN, Anakin be careful of your friend Palpatine.,Revenge of the Sith
711,ANAKIN, Be careful of what?,Revenge of the Sith
712,OBI-WAN, He has requested your presence.,Revenge of the Sith
713,ANAKIN, What for?,Revenge of the Sith
714,OBI-WAN, He would not say.,Revenge of the Sith
715,ANAKIN, He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
716,OBI-WAN, All of this is unusual and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.,Revenge of the Sith
717,ANAKIN, I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?,Revenge of the Sith
718,OBI-WAN, The Force grows dark Anakin and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.,Revenge of the Sith
721,PALPATINE, Anakin this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
722,ANAKIN, The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?,Revenge of the Sith
723,PALPATINE, They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.,Revenge of the Sith
724,ANAKIN, I agree but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.,Revenge of the Sith
725,PALPATINE, There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.,Revenge of the Sith
726,ANAKIN, With all due respect sir the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.,Revenge of the Sith
727,PALPATINE, Thank you my friend but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.,Revenge of the Sith
728,ANAKIN, Everyone will agree on that.,Revenge of the Sith
729,PALPATINE, Anakin I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith
730,ANAKIN, Of course.,Revenge of the Sith
731,PALPATINE, I need your help son.,Revenge of the Sith
732,ANAKIN, What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
733,PALPATINE, I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.,Revenge of the Sith
734,ANAKIN, I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic sir.,Revenge of the Sith
735,PALPATINE, Nevertheless their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.,Revenge of the Sith
736,ANAKIN, For what? I don't understand.,Revenge of the Sith
737,PALPATINE, To be the eyes ears and voice of the Republic . . .,Revenge of the Sith
739,PALPATINE,  Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
740,ANAKIN, Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed sir but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.,Revenge of the Sith
741,PALPATINE, I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.,Revenge of the Sith
744,BAIL ORGANA, Now that he has control of the Jedi Council the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
745,FANG ZAR, When did this happen?,Revenge of the Sith
746,BAIL ORGANA, The decree was posted this morning.,Revenge of the Sith
747,PADME, Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?,Revenge of the Sith
748,MON MOTHMA, Why bother? As a practical matter the Senate no longer exists.,Revenge of the Sith
749,GIDDEAN DANU, The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives sometimes a dozen in one day.,Revenge of the Sith
750,BAIL ORGANA, We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.,Revenge of the Sith
752,TERR TANEEL, What are you suggesting?,Revenge of the Sith
753,BAIL ORGANA, I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.,Revenge of the Sith
754,MON MOTHMA, We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
755,BAIL ORGANA, It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.,Revenge of the Sith
756,PADME, I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.,Revenge of the Sith
757,GlDDEAN DANU, Senator I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
758,MON MOTHMA, The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.,Revenge of the Sith
759,BAIL ORGANA, We can't sit around debating any longer we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .,Revenge of the Sith
760,PADME, Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point it's better to leave some things unsaid.,Revenge of the Sith
761,BAIL ORGANA, Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone without everyone in this group agreeing.,Revenge of the Sith
762,MON MOTHMA, That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.,Revenge of the Sith
764,PADME, Agreed.,Revenge of the Sith
769,MACE, Anakin Skywalker we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.,Revenge of the Sith
770,ANAKIN, I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.,Revenge of the Sith
771,YODA, Allow this appointment lightly the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.,Revenge of the Sith
772,ANAKIN, I understand.,Revenge of the Sith
773,MACE, You are on this Council but we do not grant you the rank of Master.,Revenge of the Sith
775,ANAKIN, What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?,Revenge of the Sith
776,MACE, Take a seat young Skywalker.,Revenge of the Sith
777,ANAKIN, Forgive me Master.,Revenge of the Sith
779,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, We have surveyed all systems in the Republic and have found no sign of General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
780,YODA, Hiding in the Outer Rim Grievous is. The outlying systems you must sweep.,Revenge of the Sith
781,OBI-WAN, It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.,Revenge of the Sith
782,MACE, We cannot take ships from the front line.,Revenge of the Sith
783,OBI-WAN, And yet it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.,Revenge of the Sith
784,YODA, Master Kenobi our spies contact you must and then wait.,Revenge of the Sith
785,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?,Revenge of the Sith
786,MACE, It is critical we send an attack group there immediately!,Revenge of the Sith
787,OBI-WAN, He's right that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.,Revenge of the Sith
788,ANAKIN, I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.,Revenge of the Sith
789,MACE, Skywalker your assignment is here with the Chancellor and Kenobi must find General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
790,YODA, Go I will. Good relations with the Wookiees I have.,Revenge of the Sith
791,MACE, It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.,Revenge of the Sith
795,ANAKIN, What kind of nonsense is this put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!,Revenge of the Sith
796,OBI-WAN, Calm down Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.,Revenge of the Sith
797,ANAKIN, I swear to you I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .,Revenge of the Sith
798,OBI-WAN, But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.,Revenge of the Sith
799,ANAKIN, That has nothing to do with this.,Revenge of the Sith
800,OBI-WAN, Anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation.,Revenge of the Sith
801,ANAKIN, You mean divided loyalties.,Revenge of the Sith
802,OBI-WAN, I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.,Revenge of the Sith
803,ANAKIN, The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.,Revenge of the Sith
804,OBI-WAN, No it is not. Anakin I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous dark thoughts.,Revenge of the Sith
805,ANAKIN, Master you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.,Revenge of the Sith
806,OBI-WAN, I hope so . . .,Revenge of the Sith
807,ANAKIN, I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.,Revenge of the Sith
808,OBI-WAN, Anakin the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.,Revenge of the Sith
809,ANAKIN, And?,Revenge of the Sith
810,OBI-WAN, Anakin look I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.,Revenge of the Sith
811,ANAKIN, What situation?,Revenge of the Sith
812,OBI-WAN,  The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.,Revenge of the Sith
813,ANAKIN, They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!,Revenge of the Sith
814,OBI-WAN, We are at war Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic even if the Chancellor does not.,Revenge of the Sith
815,ANAKIN, Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?,Revenge of the Sith
816,OBI-WAN, This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.,Revenge of the Sith
817,ANAKIN, The Chancellor is not a bad man Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.,Revenge of the Sith
818,OBI-WAN, That is why you must help us Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.,Revenge of the Sith
819,ANAKIN, Master the Senate demanded that he stay longer.,Revenge of the Sith
820,OBI-WAN, Yes but use your feelings Anakin. Something is out of place.,Revenge of the Sith
821,ANAKIN, You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?,Revenge of the Sith
822,OBI-WAN, The Council is asking you.,Revenge of the Sith
827,OBI-WAN, Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.,Revenge of the Sith
828,YODA, Too much under the sway of the Chancellor he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.,Revenge of the Sith
829,MACE, It's very dangerous putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.,Revenge of the Sith
830,OBI-WAN, He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.,Revenge of the Sith
831,MACE,I wish I did.,Revenge of the Sith
832,OBI-WAN, With all due respect Master is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?,Revenge of the Sith
833,MACE, So the prophecy says.,Revenge of the Sith
834,YODA, A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.,Revenge of the Sith
835,OBI-WAN, He will not let me down. He never has.,Revenge of the Sith
836,YODA, I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk I will. May the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith
840,PADME, Thank you Captain.,Revenge of the Sith
841,CAPTAIN TYPHO, Rest well. My Lady.,Revenge of the Sith
843,PADME, I'll be up in a while.,Revenge of the Sith
844,MOTEE, Yes my lady.,Revenge of the Sith
846,C-3PO, Is there anything I might do for you my lady?,Revenge of the Sith
847,PADME, Yes make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you Threepio.,Revenge of the Sith
850,ANAKIN, Beautiful isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
852,PADME, You startled me.,Revenge of the Sith
854,ANAKIN, How are you feeling?,Revenge of the Sith
855,PADME, He keeps kicking.,Revenge of the Sith
856,ANAKIN, He?! Why do you think it's a boy?,Revenge of the Sith
857,PADME,  My motherly intuition.,Revenge of the Sith
859,ANAKIN, Whoa! With a kick that strong it's got to be a girl.,Revenge of the Sith
861,PADME, I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.,Revenge of the Sith
862,ANAKIN, I may be on the Council but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.,Revenge of the Sith
863,PADME, Patience. In time they will recognize your skills.,Revenge of the Sith
864,ANAKIN, They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power that's the problem.,Revenge of the Sith
865,PADME, Anakin . . .,Revenge of the Sith
866,ANAKIN, Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
867,PADME, Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?,Revenge of the Sith
868,ANAKIN,  What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
869,PADME, What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?,Revenge of the Sith
870,ANAKIN, I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!,Revenge of the Sith
871,PADME, Anakin this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.,Revenge of the Sith
872,ANAKIN,  Don't ask me to do that Padme. Make a motion in the Senate where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!,Revenge of the Sith
873,PADME, What is it?,Revenge of the Sith
874,ANAKIN, Nothing.,Revenge of the Sith
875,PADME, Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.,Revenge of the Sith
876,ANAKIN, You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.,Revenge of the Sith
878,ANAKIN,  I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
880,PADME, I sense there are things you are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
882,PADME,  Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics no plotting ... no war.,Revenge of the Sith
885,ANAKIN, You wanted to see me Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
886,PALPATINE, Yes Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.,Revenge of the Sith
887,ANAKIN, At last we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.,Revenge of the Sith
888,PALPATINE, I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far  but they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.,Revenge of the Sith
889,ANAKIN, They try.,Revenge of the Sith
890,PALPATINE, Sit down  Leave us.,Revenge of the Sith
892,PALPATINE,  Anakin you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot they soon will.,Revenge of the Sith
893,ANAKIN, I'm not sure I understand.,Revenge of the Sith
894,PALPATINE, You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.,Revenge of the Sith
895,ANAKIN, I don't think . . .,Revenge of the Sith
896,PALPATINE, Anakin search your feelings. You know don't you?,Revenge of the Sith
897,ANAKIN, I know they don't trust you . . .,Revenge of the Sith
898,PALPATINE, Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.,Revenge of the Sith
899,ANAKIN, I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.,Revenge of the Sith
900,PALPATINE, Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didn't they?,Revenge of the Sith
902,PALPATINE,  They asked you to spy on me didn't they?,Revenge of the Sith
903,ANAKIN, I don't know ... I don't know what to say.,Revenge of the Sith
904,PALPATINE," Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. ""All those who gain power are afraid to lose it."" Even the Jedi.",Revenge of the Sith
905,ANAKIN, The Jedi use their power for good.,Revenge of the Sith
906,PALPATINE, Good is a point of view Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .,Revenge of the Sith
907,ANAKIN, . . . evil.,Revenge of the Sith
908,PALPATINE, . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.,Revenge of the Sith
909,ANAKIN, The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward only about themselves.,Revenge of the Sith
910,PALPATINE, And the Jedi don't?,Revenge of the Sith
911,ANAKIN, The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.,Revenge of the Sith
913,PALPATINE, Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?,Revenge of the Sith
914,ANAKIN, I'm not sure it's wrong.,Revenge of the Sith
915,PALPATINE, Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.,Revenge of the Sith
917,PALPATINE,"  Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""?",Revenge of the Sith
918,ANAKIN, No.,Revenge of the Sith
919,PALPATINE, I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.,Revenge of the Sith
920,ANAKIN, He could actually save people from death?,Revenge of the Sith
921,PALPATINE, The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.,Revenge of the Sith
922,ANAKIN, What happened to him?,Revenge of the Sith
923,PALPATINE, He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death but not himself.,Revenge of the Sith
924,ANAKIN, Is it possible to learn this power?,Revenge of the Sith
925,PALPATINE, Not from a Jedi.,Revenge of the Sith
930,Kl-ADI-MUNDI,  Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.,Revenge of the Sith
931,MACE,  How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.,Revenge of the Sith
932,ANAKIN, A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.,Revenge of the Sith
933,YODA, Act on this we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.,Revenge of the Sith
934,OBI-WAN, Does everyone agree?,Revenge of the Sith
936,ANAKIN, The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.,Revenge of the Sith
938,MACE,  The Council will make up its own mind who is to go not the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
939,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, Yes this decision is ours to make.,Revenge of the Sith
941,YODA, A Master is needed with more experience.,Revenge of the Sith
942,MACE, Given our resources I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.,Revenge of the Sith
943,ANAKIN, He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
945,ANAKIN,  No offense my Master but I'm only stating a fact.,Revenge of the Sith
946,OBI-WAN, Oh no you're quite right but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.,Revenge of the Sith

949,YODA, I agree.,Revenge of the Sith
951,MACE, Very well. Council is adjourned.,Revenge of the Sith
953,MACE,  Obi-Wan prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.,Revenge of the Sith
956,CLONE COMMANDER GREE, The droids have started up their main power generators.,Revenge of the Sith
957,YODA, Then now the time is Commander.,Revenge of the Sith

970,PADME, You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
971,OBI-WAN, You should be a Jedi Padme.,Revenge of the Sith
972,PADME, You're not very good at hiding your feelings.,Revenge of the Sith
973,OBI-WAN, It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.,Revenge of the Sith
974,PADME, Why would he talk to me about his work?,Revenge of the Sith
976,OBI-WAN, Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.,Revenge of the Sith

983,OBI-WAN, I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme I'm worried about him.,Revenge of the Sith
985,OBI-WAN,  I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .,Revenge of the Sith
987,OBI-WAN,  Padme I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends I care about both of you . . .,Revenge of the Sith

995,PADME, I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.,Revenge of the Sith
996,BANA BREEMU, That would be dangerous.,Revenge of the Sith

998,PADME, I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.,Revenge of the Sith
999,GiDDEAN DANU, Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.,Revenge of the Sith

1001,CHI EEKWAY, Patience Senator.,Revenge of the Sith

1003,BANA BREEMU," When you present the ""petition of the two thousand"" to the Chancellor things may change.",Revenge of the Sith
1004,BAIL ORGANA, Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate before we include the Jedi.,Revenge of the Sith
1008,ANAKIN, You're going to need me on this one Master.,Revenge of the Sith
1009,OBI-WAN, Oh I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.,Revenge of the Sith
1011,ANAKIN, Master!,Revenge of the Sith
1013,ANAKIN,  Master I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.,Revenge of the Sith
1014,OBI-WAN, You are strong and wise Anakin and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.,Revenge of the Sith
1016,OBI-WAN,  Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.,Revenge of the Sith
1017,ANAKIN, Well there's always a first time.,Revenge of the Sith
1020,ANAKIN, Obi-Wan may the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith

1028,OBI-WAN, I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.,Revenge of the Sith
1029,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, Come on boss when have I ever let you down?,Revenge of the Sith

1033,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, That was Anakin who was late. I believe.,Revenge of the Sith
1034,OBI-WAN, Very well the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.,Revenge of the Sith
1035,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, I'm counting on you.,Revenge of the Sith
1040,PALPATINE, Well Anakin did you see your friend off?,Revenge of the Sith
1041,ANAKIN, He will soon have Grievous's head.,Revenge of the Sith

1052,PALPATINE, There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.,Revenge of the Sith
1053,ANAKIN, Not fit? Why would anyone think that?,Revenge of the Sith
1054,PALPATINE, They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
1055,ANAKIN, That's ridiculous. Who?!?,Revenge of the Sith
1056,PALPATINE,  No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
1057,ANAKIN, That's impossible. I would know.,Revenge of the Sith
1058,PALPATINE, Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.,Revenge of the Sith
1060,PALPATINE,  Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.,Revenge of the Sith
1063,OBI-WAN, Save your energy.,Revenge of the Sith
1064,PADME, I can't!,Revenge of the Sith
1065,OBI-WAN, Don't give up Padme. Don't give up . . .,Revenge of the Sith

1082,ANAKIN, Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.,Revenge of the Sith
1083,PADME, They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.,Revenge of the Sith
1084,ANAKIN, Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi but I'm not satisfied ... I want more and I know I shouldn't.,Revenge of the Sith
1085,PADME, You expect too much of yourself.,Revenge of the Sith
1087,ANAKIN, I have found a way to save you.,Revenge of the Sith

1139,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.,Revenge of the Sith
1140,NUTE GUNRAY, Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip General without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.,Revenge of the Sith

1177,PALPATINE, I thank you for bringing this to my attention Senator.,Revenge of the Sith

1180,ANAKIN, What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
1181,PALPATINE, They are not to be trusted.,Revenge of the Sith
1182,ANAKIN, Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .,Revenge of the Sith
1183,PALPATINE, These are unstable times for the Republic Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.,Revenge of the Sith
1184,ANAKIN, I'm sure you're mistaken.,Revenge of the Sith
1185,PALPATINE, I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.,Revenge of the Sith
1186,ANAKIN, I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.,Revenge of the Sith
1188,PALPATINE, Yes you do but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith

intentions.",Revenge of the Sith
1193,ANAKIN, Yes Master.,Revenge of the Sith
1195,MACE WINDU, I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
1196,Kl-ADI-MUNDI," If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous then he should be removed from
office.",Revenge of the Sith
1197,MACE WiNDU, That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .,Revenge of the Sith
1198,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.,Revenge of the Sith
1199,YODA, To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.,Revenge of the Sith
1202,ANAKIN, Chancellor we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
1203,PALPATINE, We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.,Revenge of the Sith
1204,ANAKIN, I should be there with him.,Revenge of the Sith
1205,PALPATINE, It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?,Revenge of the Sith
1206,ANAKIN, I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
1207,PALPATINE, They don't trust you Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.,Revenge of the Sith
1209,ANAKIN, How do you know the ways of the Force?,Revenge of the Sith
1210,PALPATINE, My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.,Revenge of the Sith
1212,ANAKIN, You know the dark side?!?,Revenge of the Sith
1213,PALPATINE, Anakin if one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi Anakin.  They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.,Revenge of the Sith
1214,ANAKIN, I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.,Revenge of the Sith
1215,PALPATINE, Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force Anakin and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.,Revenge of the Sith

1256,ANAKIN, Master Windu I must talk to you.,Revenge of the Sith
1257,MACE WiNDU, What is it Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
1258,ANAKIN, He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.,Revenge of the Sith

1344,PALPATINE, Rise Darth Vader.,Revenge of the Sith
1350,PALPATINE, Because the Council did not trust you my young apprentice I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here they will kill us along with all the Senators.,Revenge of the Sith
1351,ANAKIN, I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
1352,PALPATINE, Every single Jedi including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that don't you?,Revenge of the Sith
1353,ANAKIN, I understand Master.,Revenge of the Sith
1354,PALPATINE, We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed it will be civil war without end. First I want you to go to the Jedi Temple.

2617,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Oh yes. General Kenobi the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.,Revenge of the Sith
2619,OBI-WAN, That depends upon your point of view. Hah!,Revenge of the Sith
2620,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.,Revenge of the Sith
2621,ANAKIN, General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.,Revenge of the Sith
2622,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Ahhhh Jedi scum . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2623,OBI-WAN, Anakin try not to upset him. We have a job to do.,Revenge of the Sith
2624,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.,Revenge of the Sith
2625,OBI-WAN, Not this time. And this time you won't escape.,Revenge of the Sith
2626,ANAKIN, Artoo.,Revenge of the Sith
2628,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Crush them! Make them suffer!,Revenge of the Sith
2632,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Stay and watch your stations.,Revenge of the Sith
2634,PILOT, Sir we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.,Revenge of the Sith
2635,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.,Revenge of the Sith
2637,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, You lose General Kenobi.,Revenge of the Sith
2639,PILOT, The ship is breaking up!,Revenge of the Sith
2640,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, We've run out of time.,Revenge of the Sith
2644,PALPATINE, The hull is burning up!,Revenge of the Sith
2649,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Time to abandon ship.,Revenge of the Sith
2655,ANAKIN, All the escape pods have been launched.,Revenge of the Sith
2656,OBI-WAN, Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?,Revenge of the Sith
2657,ANAKIN, You mean do I know how to land what's left of this thing?,Revenge of the Sith
2659,OBI-WAN, Well?,Revenge of the Sith
2660,ANAKIN, Under the circumstances I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.,Revenge of the Sith
2662,OBI-WAN, Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.,Revenge of the Sith
2664,ANAKIN, Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches extend all flaps and drag fins.,Revenge of the Sith
2665,OBI-WAN, Temp steady. Hatches open flaps extended drag fins . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2667,ANAKIN, We lost something.,Revenge of the Sith
2668,OBI-WAN, Not to worry we're still flying half the ship.,Revenge of the Sith
2669,ANAKIN, Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.,Revenge of the Sith
2670,OBI-WAN, Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2671,ANAKIN, What's our speed?,Revenge of the Sith
2672,OBI-WAN, Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2674,ANAKIN, Grab that . . . Keep us level.,Revenge of the Sith
2675,OBI-WAN, Steady. Steady.,Revenge of the Sith
2676,ANAKIN, Easy Artoo. Hang on this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.,Revenge of the Sith
2677,OBI-WAN, Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.,Revenge of the Sith
2678,FlRESHIP PILOT, We'll take you in.,Revenge of the Sith
2679,OBI-WAN, Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.,Revenge of the Sith
2680,ANAKIN, We're coming in too hot.,Revenge of the Sith
2681,OBI-WAN, Easy-easy.,Revenge of the Sith
2685,OBI-WAN, Another happy landing.,Revenge of the Sith
2688,ANAKIN,  Are you coming Master?,Revenge of the Sith
2689,OBI-WAN, Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides someone needs to be the poster boy.,Revenge of the Sith
2690,ANAKIN, Hold on this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.,Revenge of the Sith
2691,OBI-WAN, Sorry old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor carrying me unconscious on your back and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2692,ANAKIN, All because of your training Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.,Revenge of the Sith
2693,OBI-WAN, . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin let's be fair. Today you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.,Revenge of the Sith
2694,ANAKIN, All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2695,OBI-WAN, Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.,Revenge of the Sith
2697,MACE WlNDU, Chancellor Palpatine what a welcome sight! Are you all right?,Revenge of the Sith
2698,PALPATINE, Yes thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku but General Grievous has escaped once again.,Revenge of the Sith
2699,MACE WlNDU, General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.,Revenge of the Sith
2700,PALPATINE, That maybe true but with Count Dooku dead he is the leader of the Droid Army and I assure you the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.,Revenge of the Sith
2701,MACE WlNDU, Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.,Revenge of the Sith
2703,BAIL ORGANA, Skywalker the Republic cannot praise you enough.,Revenge of the Sith
2705,ANAKIN, Thank you Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.,Revenge of the Sith
2707,C-3PO, It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.,Revenge of the Sith
2709,C-3PO,  Well there I agree with you. In fact I could do with a tune-up myself.,Revenge of the Sith
2712,BAIL ORGANA, The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.,Revenge of the Sith
2713,ANAKIN, I wish that were so but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.,Revenge of the Sith
2715,BAIL ORGANA, I'll do everything I can with the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
2716,ANAKIN, Excuse me.,Revenge of the Sith
2717,BAIL ORGANA, Certainly.,Revenge of the Sith
2719,PADME, Oh Anakin! Thank goodness you're back.,Revenge of the Sith
2720,ANAKIN, I missed you Padme. I've missed you so.,Revenge of the Sith
2721,PADME, There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.,Revenge of the Sith
2722,ANAKIN, I'm back I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.,Revenge of the Sith
2724,PADME, Wait not here . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2726,ANAKIN, Yes here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.,Revenge of the Sith
2727,PADME, Anakin don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2728,ANAKIN, I've given my life to the Jedi order but I'd only give up my life for you.,Revenge of the Sith
2729,PADME,  I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.,Revenge of the Sith
2731,ANAKIN, Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?,Revenge of the Sith
2732,PADME, I'm just excited to see you.,Revenge of the Sith
2733,ANAKIN, That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?,Revenge of the Sith
2734,PADME, Nothing . . . nothing . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2735,ANAKIN, You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!,Revenge of the Sith
2737,PADME, You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2738,ANAKIN, . . . Is there someone else?,Revenge of the Sith
2739,PADME,  No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much Anakin. I do nothing to betray you yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.,Revenge of the Sith
2740,ANAKIN,  I'm afraid of losing you Padme . . . that's all.,Revenge of the Sith
2741,PADME, I will never stop loving you Anakin. My only fear is losing you.,Revenge of the Sith
2742,ANAKIN, It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2743,PADME, Something wonderful has happened.,Revenge of the Sith
2745,PADME,  I'm . . . Annie I'm pregnant.,Revenge of the Sith
2747,ANAKIN, That's . . . that's wonderful.,Revenge of the Sith
2748,PADME, What are we going to do?,Revenge of the Sith
2749,ANAKIN, We're not going to worry about anything right now all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.,Revenge of the Sith
2752,SUPER BATTLE DROID G21, The planet is secure sir. The population is under control.,Revenge of the Sith
2753,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Good. Where is the Separatist Council?,Revenge of the Sith
2754,SUPER BATTLE DROID G21, This way sir ...,Revenge of the Sith
2758,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Yes Lord Sidious.,Revenge of the Sith
2759,DARTH SlDIOUS, General Grievous I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.,Revenge of the Sith
2760,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, It will be done My Lord.,Revenge of the Sith
2761,DARTH SlDIOUS, The end of the war is near General and I promise you victory is assured.,Revenge of the Sith
2763,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, But the loss of Count Dooku?,Revenge of the Sith
2764,DARTH SlDIOUS, His death was a necessary loss which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.,Revenge of the Sith
2767,ANAKIN, . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.,Revenge of the Sith
2768,PADME, Annie I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot right by the gardens.,Revenge of the Sith
2769,ANAKIN, You are so beautiful!,Revenge of the Sith
2770,PADME, It's only because I'm so in love . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2771,ANAKIN, No it's because I'm so in love with you.,Revenge of the Sith
2772,PADME, So love has blinded you?,Revenge of the Sith
2773,ANAKIN, Well that's not exactly what I meant . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2774,PADME, But it's probably true!,Revenge of the Sith
2776,ANAKIN, I haven't laughed in so long . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2777,PADME, Neither have I.,Revenge of the Sith
2780,PADME, Anakin help me! Help Anakin! Anakin I love you. I love you.,Revenge of the Sith
2784,PADME, Anakin??,Revenge of the Sith
2788,PADME, What's bothering you?,Revenge of the Sith
2789,ANAKIN, Nothing . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2791,ANAKIN,  I remember when I gave this to you.,Revenge of the Sith
2792,PADME, Anakin how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?,Revenge of the Sith
2793,ANAKIN, It was a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
2794,PADME, Bad?,Revenge of the Sith
2795,ANAKIN, Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.,Revenge of the Sith
2796,PADME, And?,Revenge of the Sith
2797,ANAKIN, It was about you.,Revenge of the Sith
2799,PADME, Tell me.,Revenge of the Sith
2800,ANAKIN, It was only a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
2802,ANAKIN,  You die in childbirth . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2803,PADME, And the baby?,Revenge of the Sith
2804,ANAKIN, I don't know.,Revenge of the Sith
2805,PADME, It was only a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
2807,ANAKIN, . . . I won't let this one become real Padme.,Revenge of the Sith
2809,PADME, Anakin this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate and if the Council discovers you are the father you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.,Revenge of the Sith
2810,ANAKIN, I know .,Revenge of the Sith
2811,PADME, Anakin do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?,Revenge of the Sith
2812,ANAKIN,  Have you told him anything?,Revenge of the Sith
2813,PADME, No but he's your mentor your best friend . . . he must suspect something.,Revenge of the Sith
2814,ANAKIN, He's been a father to me but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!,Revenge of the Sith
2815,PADME, I won't Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith
2816,ANAKIN, I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing not a problem.,Revenge of the Sith
2819,YODA, Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2820,ANAKIN, They are of pain suffering death . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2821,YODA, Yourself you speak of or someone you know?,Revenge of the Sith
2822,ANAKIN, Someone . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2823,YODA, . . . close to you?,Revenge of the Sith
2824,ANAKIN, Yes.,Revenge of the Sith
2825,YODA, Careful you must be when sensing the future Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.,Revenge of the Sith
2826,ANAKIN, I won't let these visions come true Master Yoda.,Revenge of the Sith
2827,YODA, Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.,Revenge of the Sith
2828,ANAKIN, What must I do Master Yoda?,Revenge of the Sith
2829,YODA, Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.,Revenge of the Sith
2834,OBI-WAN, You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.,Revenge of the Sith
2835,ANAKIN, I'm sorry I was held up. I have no excuse.,Revenge of the Sith
2836,OBI-WAN, In short they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.,Revenge of the Sith
2837,ANAKIN, What's wrong then?,Revenge of the Sith
2838,OBI-WAN, The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.,Revenge of the Sith
2839,ANAKIN, Well that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.,Revenge of the Sith
2840,OBI-WAN, Anakin be careful of your friend Palpatine.,Revenge of the Sith
2841,ANAKIN, Be careful of what?,Revenge of the Sith
2842,OBI-WAN, He has requested your presence.,Revenge of the Sith
2843,ANAKIN, What for?,Revenge of the Sith
2844,OBI-WAN, He would not say.,Revenge of the Sith
2845,ANAKIN, He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
2846,OBI-WAN, All of this is unusual and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.,Revenge of the Sith
2847,ANAKIN, I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?,Revenge of the Sith
2848,OBI-WAN, The Force grows dark Anakin and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.,Revenge of the Sith
2851,PALPATINE, Anakin this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
2852,ANAKIN, The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?,Revenge of the Sith
2853,PALPATINE, They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.,Revenge of the Sith
2854,ANAKIN, I agree but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.,Revenge of the Sith
2855,PALPATINE, There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.,Revenge of the Sith
2856,ANAKIN, With all due respect sir the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.,Revenge of the Sith
2857,PALPATINE, Thank you my friend but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.,Revenge of the Sith
2858,ANAKIN, Everyone will agree on that.,Revenge of the Sith
2859,PALPATINE, Anakin I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith
2860,ANAKIN, Of course.,Revenge of the Sith
2861,PALPATINE, I need your help son.,Revenge of the Sith
2862,ANAKIN, What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
2863,PALPATINE, I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.,Revenge of the Sith
2864,ANAKIN, I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic sir.,Revenge of the Sith
2865,PALPATINE, Nevertheless their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.,Revenge of the Sith
2866,ANAKIN, For what? I don't understand.,Revenge of the Sith
2867,PALPATINE, To be the eyes ears and voice of the Republic . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2869,PALPATINE,  Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
2870,ANAKIN, Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed sir but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.,Revenge of the Sith
2871,PALPATINE, I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.,Revenge of the Sith
2874,BAIL ORGANA, Now that he has control of the Jedi Council the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
2875,FANG ZAR, When did this happen?,Revenge of the Sith
2876,BAIL ORGANA, The decree was posted this morning.,Revenge of the Sith
2877,PADME, Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?,Revenge of the Sith
2878,MON MOTHMA, Why bother? As a practical matter the Senate no longer exists.,Revenge of the Sith
2879,GIDDEAN DANU, The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives sometimes a dozen in one day.,Revenge of the Sith
2880,BAIL ORGANA, We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.,Revenge of the Sith
2882,TERR TANEEL, What are you suggesting?,Revenge of the Sith
2883,BAIL ORGANA, I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.,Revenge of the Sith
2884,MON MOTHMA, We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
2885,BAIL ORGANA, It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.,Revenge of the Sith
2886,PADME, I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.,Revenge of the Sith
2887,GlDDEAN DANU, Senator I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
2888,MON MOTHMA, The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.,Revenge of the Sith
2889,BAIL ORGANA, We can't sit around debating any longer we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2890,PADME, Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point it's better to leave some things unsaid.,Revenge of the Sith
2891,BAIL ORGANA, Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone without everyone in this group agreeing.,Revenge of the Sith
2892,MON MOTHMA, That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.,Revenge of the Sith
2894,PADME, Agreed.,Revenge of the Sith
2899,MACE, Anakin Skywalker we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.,Revenge of the Sith
2900,ANAKIN, I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.,Revenge of the Sith
2901,YODA, Allow this appointment lightly the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.,Revenge of the Sith
2902,ANAKIN, I understand.,Revenge of the Sith
2903,MACE, You are on this Council but we do not grant you the rank of Master.,Revenge of the Sith
2905,ANAKIN, What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?,Revenge of the Sith
2906,MACE, Take a seat young Skywalker.,Revenge of the Sith
2907,ANAKIN, Forgive me Master.,Revenge of the Sith
2909,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, We have surveyed all systems in the Republic and have found no sign of General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
2910,YODA, Hiding in the Outer Rim Grievous is. The outlying systems you must sweep.,Revenge of the Sith
2911,OBI-WAN, It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.,Revenge of the Sith
2912,MACE, We cannot take ships from the front line.,Revenge of the Sith
2913,OBI-WAN, And yet it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.,Revenge of the Sith
2914,YODA, Master Kenobi our spies contact you must and then wait.,Revenge of the Sith
2915,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?,Revenge of the Sith
2916,MACE, It is critical we send an attack group there immediately!,Revenge of the Sith
2917,OBI-WAN, He's right that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.,Revenge of the Sith
2918,ANAKIN, I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.,Revenge of the Sith
2919,MACE, Skywalker your assignment is here with the Chancellor and Kenobi must find General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
2920,YODA, Go I will. Good relations with the Wookiees I have.,Revenge of the Sith
2921,MACE, It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.,Revenge of the Sith
2925,ANAKIN, What kind of nonsense is this put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!,Revenge of the Sith
2926,OBI-WAN, Calm down Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.,Revenge of the Sith
2927,ANAKIN, I swear to you I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2928,OBI-WAN, But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.,Revenge of the Sith
2929,ANAKIN, That has nothing to do with this.,Revenge of the Sith
2930,OBI-WAN, Anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation.,Revenge of the Sith
2931,ANAKIN, You mean divided loyalties.,Revenge of the Sith
2932,OBI-WAN, I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.,Revenge of the Sith
2933,ANAKIN, The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.,Revenge of the Sith
2934,OBI-WAN, No it is not. Anakin I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous dark thoughts.,Revenge of the Sith
2935,ANAKIN, Master you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.,Revenge of the Sith
2936,OBI-WAN, I hope so . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2937,ANAKIN, I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.,Revenge of the Sith
2938,OBI-WAN, Anakin the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.,Revenge of the Sith
2939,ANAKIN, And?,Revenge of the Sith
2940,OBI-WAN, Anakin look I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.,Revenge of the Sith
2941,ANAKIN, What situation?,Revenge of the Sith
2942,OBI-WAN,  The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.,Revenge of the Sith
2943,ANAKIN, They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!,Revenge of the Sith
2944,OBI-WAN, We are at war Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic even if the Chancellor does not.,Revenge of the Sith
2945,ANAKIN, Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?,Revenge of the Sith
2946,OBI-WAN, This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.,Revenge of the Sith
2947,ANAKIN, The Chancellor is not a bad man Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.,Revenge of the Sith
2948,OBI-WAN, That is why you must help us Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.,Revenge of the Sith
2949,ANAKIN, Master the Senate demanded that he stay longer.,Revenge of the Sith
2950,OBI-WAN, Yes but use your feelings Anakin. Something is out of place.,Revenge of the Sith
2951,ANAKIN, You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?,Revenge of the Sith
2952,OBI-WAN, The Council is asking you.,Revenge of the Sith
2957,OBI-WAN, Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.,Revenge of the Sith
2958,YODA, Too much under the sway of the Chancellor he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.,Revenge of the Sith
2959,MACE, It's very dangerous putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.,Revenge of the Sith
2960,OBI-WAN, He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.,Revenge of the Sith
2961,MACE,I wish I did.,Revenge of the Sith
2962,OBI-WAN, With all due respect Master is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?,Revenge of the Sith
2963,MACE, So the prophecy says.,Revenge of the Sith
2964,YODA, A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.,Revenge of the Sith
2965,OBI-WAN, He will not let me down. He never has.,Revenge of the Sith
2966,YODA, I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk I will. May the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith
2970,PADME, Thank you Captain.,Revenge of the Sith
2971,CAPTAIN TYPHO, Rest well. My Lady.,Revenge of the Sith
2973,PADME, I'll be up in a while.,Revenge of the Sith
2974,MOTEE, Yes my lady.,Revenge of the Sith
2976,C-3PO, Is there anything I might do for you my lady?,Revenge of the Sith
2977,PADME, Yes make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you Threepio.,Revenge of the Sith
2980,ANAKIN, Beautiful isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
2982,PADME, You startled me.,Revenge of the Sith
2984,ANAKIN, How are you feeling?,Revenge of the Sith
2985,PADME, He keeps kicking.,Revenge of the Sith
2986,ANAKIN, He?! Why do you think it's a boy?,Revenge of the Sith
2987,PADME,  My motherly intuition.,Revenge of the Sith
2989,ANAKIN, Whoa! With a kick that strong it's got to be a girl.,Revenge of the Sith
2991,PADME, I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.,Revenge of the Sith
2992,ANAKIN, I may be on the Council but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.,Revenge of the Sith
2993,PADME, Patience. In time they will recognize your skills.,Revenge of the Sith
2994,ANAKIN, They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power that's the problem.,Revenge of the Sith
2995,PADME, Anakin . . .,Revenge of the Sith
2996,ANAKIN, Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
2997,PADME, Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?,Revenge of the Sith
2998,ANAKIN,  What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
2999,PADME, What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?,Revenge of the Sith
3000,ANAKIN, I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!,Revenge of the Sith
3001,PADME, Anakin this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.,Revenge of the Sith
3002,ANAKIN,  Don't ask me to do that Padme. Make a motion in the Senate where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!,Revenge of the Sith
3003,PADME, What is it?,Revenge of the Sith
3004,ANAKIN, Nothing.,Revenge of the Sith
3005,PADME, Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.,Revenge of the Sith
3006,ANAKIN, You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.,Revenge of the Sith
3008,ANAKIN,  I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
3010,PADME, I sense there are things you are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
3012,PADME,  Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics no plotting ... no war.,Revenge of the Sith
3015,ANAKIN, You wanted to see me Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
3016,PALPATINE, Yes Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.,Revenge of the Sith
3017,ANAKIN, At last we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.,Revenge of the Sith
3018,PALPATINE, I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far  but they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.,Revenge of the Sith
3019,ANAKIN, They try.,Revenge of the Sith
3020,PALPATINE, Sit down  Leave us.,Revenge of the Sith
3022,PALPATINE,  Anakin you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot they soon will.,Revenge of the Sith
3023,ANAKIN, I'm not sure I understand.,Revenge of the Sith
3024,PALPATINE, You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.,Revenge of the Sith
3025,ANAKIN, I don't think . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3026,PALPATINE, Anakin search your feelings. You know don't you?,Revenge of the Sith
3027,ANAKIN, I know they don't trust you . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3028,PALPATINE, Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.,Revenge of the Sith
3029,ANAKIN, I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.,Revenge of the Sith
3030,PALPATINE, Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didn't they?,Revenge of the Sith
3032,PALPATINE,  They asked you to spy on me didn't they?,Revenge of the Sith
3033,ANAKIN, I don't know ... I don't know what to say.,Revenge of the Sith
3034,PALPATINE," Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. ""All those who gain power are afraid to lose it."" Even the Jedi.",Revenge of the Sith
3035,ANAKIN, The Jedi use their power for good.,Revenge of the Sith
3036,PALPATINE, Good is a point of view Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .,Revenge of the Sith
3037,ANAKIN, . . . evil.,Revenge of the Sith
3038,PALPATINE, . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.,Revenge of the Sith
3039,ANAKIN, The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward only about themselves.,Revenge of the Sith
3040,PALPATINE, And the Jedi don't?,Revenge of the Sith
3041,ANAKIN, The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.,Revenge of the Sith
3043,PALPATINE, Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?,Revenge of the Sith
3044,ANAKIN, I'm not sure it's wrong.,Revenge of the Sith
3045,PALPATINE, Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.,Revenge of the Sith
3047,PALPATINE,"  Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""?",Revenge of the Sith
3048,ANAKIN, No.,Revenge of the Sith
3049,PALPATINE, I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.,Revenge of the Sith
3050,ANAKIN, He could actually save people from death?,Revenge of the Sith
3051,PALPATINE, The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.,Revenge of the Sith
3052,ANAKIN, What happened to him?,Revenge of the Sith
3053,PALPATINE, He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death but not himself.,Revenge of the Sith
3054,ANAKIN, Is it possible to learn this power?,Revenge of the Sith
3055,PALPATINE, Not from a Jedi.,Revenge of the Sith
3060,Kl-ADI-MUNDI,  Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.,Revenge of the Sith
3061,MACE,  How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.,Revenge of the Sith
3062,ANAKIN, A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.,Revenge of the Sith
3063,YODA, Act on this we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.,Revenge of the Sith
3064,OBI-WAN, Does everyone agree?,Revenge of the Sith
3066,ANAKIN, The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.,Revenge of the Sith
3068,MACE,  The Council will make up its own mind who is to go not the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
3069,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, Yes this decision is ours to make.,Revenge of the Sith
3071,YODA, A Master is needed with more experience.,Revenge of the Sith
3072,MACE, Given our resources I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.,Revenge of the Sith
3073,ANAKIN, He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
3075,ANAKIN,  No offense my Master but I'm only stating a fact.,Revenge of the Sith
3076,OBI-WAN, Oh no you're quite right but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.,Revenge of the Sith
3077,YODA, Obi-Wan my choice is.,Revenge of the Sith
3078,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, I concur. Master Kenobi should go.,Revenge of the Sith
3079,YODA, I agree.,Revenge of the Sith
3081,MACE, Very well. Council is adjourned.,Revenge of the Sith
3083,MACE,  Obi-Wan prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.,Revenge of the Sith
3086,CLONE COMMANDER GREE, The droids have started up their main power generators.,Revenge of the Sith
3087,YODA, Then now the time is Commander.,Revenge of the Sith
3088,CLONE COMMANDER GREE, Yes sir.,Revenge of the Sith
3096,OBI-WAN, Has Anakin been to see you?,Revenge of the Sith
3097,PADME, Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
3098,OBI-WAN, I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient strong willed very opinionated but truly gifted.,Revenge of the Sith
3100,PADME, You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
3101,OBI-WAN, You should be a Jedi Padme.,Revenge of the Sith
3102,PADME, You're not very good at hiding your feelings.,Revenge of the Sith
3103,OBI-WAN, It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.,Revenge of the Sith
3104,PADME, Why would he talk to me about his work?,Revenge of the Sith
3106,OBI-WAN, Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.,Revenge of the Sith
3107,PADME, Don't give me that look.,Revenge of the Sith
3108,OBI-WAN, I know how he feels about you.,Revenge of the Sith
3109,PADME,  What did he say?,Revenge of the Sith
3110,OBI-WAN, Nothing. He didn't have to.,Revenge of the Sith
3112,PADME, I don't know what you're talking about.,Revenge of the Sith
3113,OBI-WAN, I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme I'm worried about him.,Revenge of the Sith
3115,OBI-WAN,  I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3117,OBI-WAN,  Padme I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends I care about both of you . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3118,PADME, Thank you Obi-Wan.,Revenge of the Sith
3119,OBI-WAN, Please do what you can to help him.,Revenge of the Sith
3122,PADME, We cannot let this turn into another war.,Revenge of the Sith
3123,BAIL ORGANA, Absolutely that is the last thing we want.,Revenge of the Sith
3124,MON MOTHMA, We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution that's all.,Revenge of the Sith
3125,PADME, I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.,Revenge of the Sith
3126,BANA BREEMU, That would be dangerous.,Revenge of the Sith
3127,MON MOTHMA, We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.,Revenge of the Sith
3128,PADME, I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.,Revenge of the Sith
3129,GiDDEAN DANU, Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.,Revenge of the Sith
3130,PADME, The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3131,CHI EEKWAY, Patience Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
3132,FANG ZAR, We have so many Senators on our side surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
3133,BANA BREEMU," When you present the ""petition of the two thousand"" to the Chancellor things may change.",Revenge of the Sith
3134,BAIL ORGANA, Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate before we include the Jedi.,Revenge of the Sith
3138,ANAKIN, You're going to need me on this one Master.,Revenge of the Sith
3139,OBI-WAN, Oh I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.,Revenge of the Sith
3141,ANAKIN, Master!,Revenge of the Sith
3143,ANAKIN,  Master I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.,Revenge of the Sith
3144,OBI-WAN, You are strong and wise Anakin and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.,Revenge of the Sith
3146,OBI-WAN,  Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.,Revenge of the Sith
3147,ANAKIN, Well there's always a first time.,Revenge of the Sith
3150,ANAKIN, Obi-Wan may the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith
3151,OBI-WAN, Good-bye old friend. May the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith
3157,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, Fortunately most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.,Revenge of the Sith
3158,OBI-WAN, I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.,Revenge of the Sith
3159,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, Come on boss when have I ever let you down?,Revenge of the Sith
3161,OBI-WAN,  Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.,Revenge of the Sith
3163,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, That was Anakin who was late. I believe.,Revenge of the Sith
3164,OBI-WAN, Very well the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.,Revenge of the Sith
3165,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, I'm counting on you.,Revenge of the Sith
3170,PALPATINE, Well Anakin did you see your friend off?,Revenge of the Sith
3171,ANAKIN, He will soon have Grievous's head.,Revenge of the Sith
3172,PALPATINE, We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.,Revenge of the Sith
3173,ANAKIN, The Council was very sure in its decision.,Revenge of the Sith
3177,JAR JAR, Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3179,ANAKIN, Hi Jar Jar.,Revenge of the Sith
3180,JAR JAR, Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry Your Highness sir.,Revenge of the Sith
3182,PALPATINE, There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.,Revenge of the Sith
3183,ANAKIN, Not fit? Why would anyone think that?,Revenge of the Sith
3184,PALPATINE, They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
3185,ANAKIN, That's ridiculous. Who?!?,Revenge of the Sith
3186,PALPATINE,  No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
3187,ANAKIN, That's impossible. I would know.,Revenge of the Sith
3188,PALPATINE, Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.,Revenge of the Sith
3190,PALPATINE,  Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.,Revenge of the Sith
3193,OBI-WAN, Save your energy.,Revenge of the Sith
3194,PADME, I can't!,Revenge of the Sith
3195,OBI-WAN, Don't give up Padme. Don't give up . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3198,ANAKIN, I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here hasn't he?,Revenge of the Sith
3199,PADME, He came by this morning.,Revenge of the Sith
3200,ANAKIN, What did he want?,Revenge of the Sith
3202,PADME, He's worried about you.,Revenge of the Sith
3203,ANAKIN, You told him about us didn't you?,Revenge of the Sith
3205,PADME, He's your best friend Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.,Revenge of the Sith
3206,ANAKIN, And he's not?,Revenge of the Sith
3207,PADME, You have been moody lately.,Revenge of the Sith
3208,ANAKIN, I'm not moody . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3209,PADME, Anakin! Don't do this again.,Revenge of the Sith
3210,ANAKIN, I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.,Revenge of the Sith
3211,PADME, Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.,Revenge of the Sith
3212,ANAKIN, Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.,Revenge of the Sith
3213,PADME, They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.,Revenge of the Sith
3214,ANAKIN, Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi but I'm not satisfied ... I want more and I know I shouldn't.,Revenge of the Sith
3215,PADME, You expect too much of yourself.,Revenge of the Sith
3217,ANAKIN, I have found a way to save you.,Revenge of the Sith
3218,PADME, Save me?,Revenge of the Sith
3219,ANAKIN, From my nightmares.,Revenge of the Sith
3220,PADME, Is that what's bothering you?,Revenge of the Sith
3221,ANAKIN, I won't lose you Padme.,Revenge of the Sith
3222,PADME, I'm not going to die in childbirth Annie. I promise you.,Revenge of the Sith
3223,ANAKIN, No I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force I will be able to keep you from dying.,Revenge of the Sith

3232,OBI-WAN, Unfortunately the war.,Revenge of the Sith
3233,TlON MEDON, There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.,Revenge of the Sith
3234,OBI-WAN, With your kind permission I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
3236,TlON MEDON, He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.,Revenge of the Sith
3237,OBI-WAN, I understand.,Revenge of the Sith
3238,TlON MEDON, The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .,Revenge of the Sith

3263,OBI-WAN, Good girl Boga.,Revenge of the Sith
3269,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.,Revenge of the Sith
3270,NUTE GUNRAY, Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip General without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.,Revenge of the Sith
3271,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Be thankful Viceroy you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.,Revenge of the Sith
3275,OBI-WAN, Hello there!,Revenge of the Sith
3276,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, General Kenobi you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed  Kill him!,Revenge of the Sith
3278,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Enough of this.,Revenge of the Sith
3280,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.,Revenge of the Sith
3281,OBI-WAN, Your move.,Revenge of the Sith
3282,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack Kenobi.,Revenge of the Sith
3284,OBI-WAN, You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!,Revenge of the Sith
3286,OBI-WAN, I may not defeat your droids but my troops certainly will.,Revenge of the Sith
3287,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Army or not you must realize you are doomed.,Revenge of the Sith
3288,OBI-WAN, I don't think so.,Revenge of the Sith
3298,PALPATINE, I understand your reservations completely Senator and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
3299,PADME, May I take it then that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?,Revenge of the Sith
3300,PALPATINE, I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do My Lady and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3301,PADME, You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war then.,Revenge of the Sith
3302,PALPATINE, You must trust me to do the right things Senator. That is why I am here.,Revenge of the Sith
3303,FANGZAR, But surely . . .,Revenge of the Sith

3307,PALPATINE, I thank you for bringing this to my attention Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
3309,PALPATINE,  Their sincerity is to be admired although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.,Revenge of the Sith
3310,ANAKIN, What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
3311,PALPATINE, They are not to be trusted.,Revenge of the Sith
3312,ANAKIN, Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3313,PALPATINE, These are unstable times for the Republic Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.,Revenge of the Sith
3314,ANAKIN, I'm sure you're mistaken.,Revenge of the Sith
3315,PALPATINE, I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.,Revenge of the Sith
3316,ANAKIN, I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.,Revenge of the Sith
3318,PALPATINE, Yes you do but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith
3321,CLONE COMMANDER CODY," Master Windu may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous and we
have begun our attack.",Revenge of the Sith
3322,MACE WlNDU," Thank you Commander. Anakin deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
intentions.",Revenge of the Sith
3323,ANAKIN, Yes Master.,Revenge of the Sith
3325,MACE WINDU, I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
3326,Kl-ADI-MUNDI," If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous then he should be removed from
office.",Revenge of the Sith
3327,MACE WiNDU, That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .,Revenge of the Sith
3328,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.,Revenge of the Sith
3329,YODA, To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.,Revenge of the Sith
3332,ANAKIN, Chancellor we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
3333,PALPATINE, We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.,Revenge of the Sith
3334,ANAKIN, I should be there with him.,Revenge of the Sith
3335,PALPATINE, It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?,Revenge of the Sith
3336,ANAKIN, I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
3337,PALPATINE, They don't trust you Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.,Revenge of the Sith
3339,ANAKIN, How do you know the ways of the Force?,Revenge of the Sith
3340,PALPATINE, My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.,Revenge of the Sith
3342,ANAKIN, You know the dark side?!?,Revenge of the Sith
3343,PALPATINE, Anakin if one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi Anakin.  They fear you. In time they will destroy you.

4503,ANAKIN, I was about to say that.,Revenge of the Sith
4505,PALPATINE, Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.,Revenge of the Sith
4506,OBI-WAN, Chancellor Palpatine Sith Lords are our specialty.,Revenge of the Sith
4508,COUNT DOOKU, Your swords please Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith

4513,ANAKIN, My powers have doubled since the last time we met Count.,Revenge of the Sith
4514,COUNT DOOKU, Good. Twice the pride double the fall.,Revenge of the Sith
4516,COUNT DOOKU,  Your moves are clumsy Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.,Revenge of the Sith
4518,COUNT DOOKU,  I sense great fear in you Skywalker. You have hate you have anger but you dont use them.,Revenge of the Sith
4522,PALPATINE, Good Anakin good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!,Revenge of the Sith
4523,ANAKIN, I shouldn't . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4524,PALPATINE, Do it!!,Revenge of the Sith
4526,ANAKIN, ... I couldn't stop myself.,Revenge of the Sith
4527,PALPATINE, You did well Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.,Revenge of the Sith
4529,ANAKIN, Yes but he was an unarmed prisoner.,Revenge of the Sith
4531,ANAKIN,  I shouldn't have done that Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.,Revenge of the Sith
4533,PALPATINE, It is only natural. He cut off your arm and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now we must leave before more security droids arrive.,Revenge of the Sith
4535,PALPATINE,  Anakin there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.,Revenge of the Sith
4536,ANAKIN, He seems to be all right. No broken bones breathing's all right.,Revenge of the Sith

4611,ANAKIN/OBI-WAN, Well that was close.,Revenge of the Sith
4614,BODYGUARD, General we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.,Revenge of the Sith
4615,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Activate ray shields.,Revenge of the Sith
4618,ANAKIN, Ray shields!,Revenge of the Sith
4620,OBI-WAN, Wait a minute how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.,Revenge of the Sith
4621,ANAKIN, Apparently not Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.,Revenge of the Sith
4622,OBI-WAN, Oh so all of a sudden it's my fault.,Revenge of the Sith
4623,ANAKIN, You're the Master. I'm just a hero.,Revenge of the Sith
4624,OBI-WAN, I'm open to suggestions here.,Revenge of the Sith
4625,PALPATINE, Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise we can negotiate our release.,Revenge of the Sith
4627,ANAKIN, I say . . . patience.,Revenge of the Sith
4628,OBI-WAN, Patience! That's your plan is it?,Revenge of the Sith
4629,ANAKIN, Yes Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4631,ANAKIN,  See! No problem.,Revenge of the Sith

4634,OBI-WAN, Do you have a plan B?,Revenge of the Sith
4637,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Oh yes. General Kenobi the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.,Revenge of the Sith
4639,OBI-WAN, That depends upon your point of view. Hah!,Revenge of the Sith
4640,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.,Revenge of the Sith
4641,ANAKIN, General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.,Revenge of the Sith
4642,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Ahhhh Jedi scum . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4643,OBI-WAN, Anakin try not to upset him. We have a job to do.,Revenge of the Sith
4644,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.,Revenge of the Sith
4645,OBI-WAN, Not this time. And this time you won't escape.,Revenge of the Sith
4646,ANAKIN, Artoo.,Revenge of the Sith

4652,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Stay and watch your stations.,Revenge of the Sith
4654,PILOT, Sir we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.,Revenge of the Sith
4655,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.,Revenge of the Sith
4657,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, You lose General Kenobi.,Revenge of the Sith
4659,PILOT, The ship is breaking up!,Revenge of the Sith
4660,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, We've run out of time.,Revenge of the Sith
4664,PALPATINE, The hull is burning up!,Revenge of the Sith
4669,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Time to abandon ship.,Revenge of the Sith
4675,ANAKIN, All the escape pods have been launched.,Revenge of the Sith
4676,OBI-WAN, Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?,Revenge of the Sith
4677,ANAKIN, You mean do I know how to land what's left of this thing?,Revenge of the Sith
4679,OBI-WAN, Well?,Revenge of the Sith
4680,ANAKIN, Under the circumstances I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.,Revenge of the Sith
4682,OBI-WAN, Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.,Revenge of the Sith
4684,ANAKIN, Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches extend all flaps and drag fins.,Revenge of the Sith
4685,OBI-WAN, Temp steady. Hatches open flaps extended drag fins . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4687,ANAKIN, We lost something.,Revenge of the Sith
4688,OBI-WAN, Not to worry we're still flying half the ship.,Revenge of the Sith
4689,ANAKIN, Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.,Revenge of the Sith
4690,OBI-WAN, Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4691,ANAKIN, What's our speed?,Revenge of the Sith
4692,OBI-WAN, Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4694,ANAKIN, Grab that . . . Keep us level.,Revenge of the Sith
4695,OBI-WAN, Steady. Steady.,Revenge of the Sith
4696,ANAKIN, Easy Artoo. Hang on this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.,Revenge of the Sith

4700,ANAKIN, We're coming in too hot.,Revenge of the Sith
4701,OBI-WAN, Easy-easy.,Revenge of the Sith
4705,OBI-WAN, Another happy landing.,Revenge of the Sith
4708,ANAKIN,  Are you coming Master?,Revenge of the Sith
4709,OBI-WAN, Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides someone needs to be the poster boy.,Revenge of the Sith
4710,ANAKIN, Hold on this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.,Revenge of the Sith
4711,OBI-WAN, Sorry old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor carrying me unconscious on your back and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4712,ANAKIN, All because of your training Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.,Revenge of the Sith
4713,OBI-WAN, . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin let's be fair. Today you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.,Revenge of the Sith
4714,ANAKIN, All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4715,OBI-WAN, Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.,Revenge of the Sith
4717,MACE WlNDU, Chancellor Palpatine what a welcome sight! Are you all right?,Revenge of the Sith
4718,PALPATINE, Yes thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku but General Grievous has escaped once again.,Revenge of the Sith
4719,MACE WlNDU, General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.,Revenge of the Sith
4720,PALPATINE, That maybe true but with Count Dooku dead he is the leader of the Droid Army and I assure you the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.,Revenge of the Sith
4721,MACE WlNDU, Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.,Revenge of the Sith
4723,BAIL ORGANA, Skywalker the Republic cannot praise you enough.,Revenge of the Sith
4725,ANAKIN, Thank you Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.,Revenge of the Sith
4727,C-3PO, It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.,Revenge of the Sith
4729,C-3PO,  Well there I agree with you. In fact I could do with a tune-up myself.,Revenge of the Sith
4732,BAIL ORGANA, The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.,Revenge of the Sith
4733,ANAKIN, I wish that were so but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.,Revenge of the Sith
4735,BAIL ORGANA, I'll do everything I can with the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
4736,ANAKIN, Excuse me.,Revenge of the Sith
4737,BAIL ORGANA, Certainly.,Revenge of the Sith
4739,PADME, Oh Anakin! Thank goodness you're back.,Revenge of the Sith
4740,ANAKIN, I missed you Padme. I've missed you so.,Revenge of the Sith
4741,PADME, There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.,Revenge of the Sith
4742,ANAKIN, I'm back I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.,Revenge of the Sith
4744,PADME, Wait not here . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4746,ANAKIN, Yes here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.,Revenge of the Sith
4747,PADME, Anakin don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4748,ANAKIN, I've given my life to the Jedi order but I'd only give up my life for you.,Revenge of the Sith
4749,PADME,  I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.,Revenge of the Sith
4751,ANAKIN, Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?,Revenge of the Sith
4752,PADME, I'm just excited to see you.,Revenge of the Sith
4753,ANAKIN, That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?,Revenge of the Sith
4754,PADME, Nothing . . . nothing . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4755,ANAKIN, You're frightened.  Tell me what's going on!,Revenge of the Sith
4757,PADME, You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4758,ANAKIN, . . . Is there someone else?,Revenge of the Sith
4759,PADME,  No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much Anakin. I do nothing to betray you yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.,Revenge of the Sith
4760,ANAKIN,  I'm afraid of losing you Padme . . . that's all.,Revenge of the Sith
4761,PADME, I will never stop loving you Anakin. My only fear is losing you.,Revenge of the Sith
4762,ANAKIN, It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4763,PADME, Something wonderful has happened.,Revenge of the Sith
4765,PADME,  I'm . . . Annie I'm pregnant.,Revenge of the Sith
4767,ANAKIN, That's . . . that's wonderful.,Revenge of the Sith
4768,PADME, What are we going to do?,Revenge of the Sith
4769,ANAKIN, We're not going to worry about anything right now all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.,Revenge of the Sith
4772,SUPER BATTLE DROID G21, The planet is secure sir. The population is under control.,Revenge of the Sith
4773,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Good. Where is the Separatist Council?,Revenge of the Sith
4774,SUPER BATTLE DROID G21, This way sir ...,Revenge of the Sith
4778,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, Yes Lord Sidious.,Revenge of the Sith
4779,DARTH SlDIOUS, General Grievous I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.,Revenge of the Sith
4780,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, It will be done My Lord.,Revenge of the Sith
4781,DARTH SlDIOUS, The end of the war is near General and I promise you victory is assured.,Revenge of the Sith
4783,GENERAL GRIEVOUS, But the loss of Count Dooku?,Revenge of the Sith
4784,DARTH SlDIOUS, His death was a necessary loss which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.,Revenge of the Sith
4787,ANAKIN, . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.,Revenge of the Sith
4788,PADME, Annie I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot right by the gardens.,Revenge of the Sith
4789,ANAKIN, You are so beautiful!,Revenge of the Sith
4790,PADME, It's only because I'm so in love . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4791,ANAKIN, No it's because I'm so in love with you.,Revenge of the Sith
4792,PADME, So love has blinded you?,Revenge of the Sith
4793,ANAKIN, Well that's not exactly what I meant . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4794,PADME, But it's probably true!,Revenge of the Sith
4796,ANAKIN, I haven't laughed in so long . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4797,PADME, Neither have I.,Revenge of the Sith
4800,PADME, Anakin help me! Help Anakin! Anakin I love you. I love you.,Revenge of the Sith
4804,PADME, Anakin??,Revenge of the Sith
4808,PADME, What's bothering you?,Revenge of the Sith
4809,ANAKIN, Nothing . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4811,ANAKIN,  I remember when I gave this to you.,Revenge of the Sith
4812,PADME, Anakin how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?,Revenge of the Sith
4813,ANAKIN, It was a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
4814,PADME, Bad?,Revenge of the Sith
4815,ANAKIN, Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.,Revenge of the Sith
4816,PADME, And?,Revenge of the Sith
4817,ANAKIN, It was about you.,Revenge of the Sith
4819,PADME, Tell me.,Revenge of the Sith
4820,ANAKIN, It was only a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
4822,ANAKIN,  You die in childbirth . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4823,PADME, And the baby?,Revenge of the Sith
4824,ANAKIN, I don't know.,Revenge of the Sith
4825,PADME, It was only a dream.,Revenge of the Sith
4827,ANAKIN, . . . I won't let this one become real Padme.,Revenge of the Sith
4829,PADME, Anakin this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate and if the Council discovers you are the father you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.,Revenge of the Sith
4830,ANAKIN, I know .,Revenge of the Sith
4831,PADME, Anakin do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?,Revenge of the Sith
4832,ANAKIN,  Have you told him anything?,Revenge of the Sith
4833,PADME, No but he's your mentor your best friend . . . he must suspect something.,Revenge of the Sith
4834,ANAKIN, He's been a father to me but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!,Revenge of the Sith
4835,PADME, I won't Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith
4836,ANAKIN, I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing not a problem.,Revenge of the Sith
4839,YODA, Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4840,ANAKIN, They are of pain suffering death . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4841,YODA, Yourself you speak of or someone you know?,Revenge of the Sith
4842,ANAKIN, Someone . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4843,YODA, . . . close to you?,Revenge of the Sith
4844,ANAKIN, Yes.,Revenge of the Sith
4845,YODA, Careful you must be when sensing the future Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.,Revenge of the Sith
4846,ANAKIN, I won't let these visions come true Master Yoda.,Revenge of the Sith
4847,YODA, Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed that is.,Revenge of the Sith
4848,ANAKIN, What must I do Master Yoda?,Revenge of the Sith
4849,YODA, Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.,Revenge of the Sith
4854,OBI-WAN, You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.,Revenge of the Sith
4855,ANAKIN, I'm sorry I was held up. I have no excuse.,Revenge of the Sith
4856,OBI-WAN, In short they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.,Revenge of the Sith
4857,ANAKIN, What's wrong then?,Revenge of the Sith
4858,OBI-WAN, The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.,Revenge of the Sith
4859,ANAKIN, Well that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.,Revenge of the Sith
4860,OBI-WAN, Anakin be careful of your friend Palpatine.,Revenge of the Sith
4861,ANAKIN, Be careful of what?,Revenge of the Sith
4862,OBI-WAN, He has requested your presence.,Revenge of the Sith
4863,ANAKIN, What for?,Revenge of the Sith
4864,OBI-WAN, He would not say.,Revenge of the Sith
4865,ANAKIN, He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
4866,OBI-WAN, All of this is unusual and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.,Revenge of the Sith
4867,ANAKIN, I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?,Revenge of the Sith
4868,OBI-WAN, The Force grows dark Anakin and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.,Revenge of the Sith
4871,PALPATINE, Anakin this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
4872,ANAKIN, The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?,Revenge of the Sith
4873,PALPATINE, They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.,Revenge of the Sith
4874,ANAKIN, I agree but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.,Revenge of the Sith
4875,PALPATINE, There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.,Revenge of the Sith
4876,ANAKIN, With all due respect sir the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.,Revenge of the Sith
4877,PALPATINE, Thank you my friend but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.,Revenge of the Sith
4878,ANAKIN, Everyone will agree on that.,Revenge of the Sith
4879,PALPATINE, Anakin I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me Anakin.,Revenge of the Sith
4880,ANAKIN, Of course.,Revenge of the Sith
4881,PALPATINE, I need your help son.,Revenge of the Sith
4882,ANAKIN, What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
4883,PALPATINE, I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.,Revenge of the Sith
4884,ANAKIN, I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic sir.,Revenge of the Sith
4885,PALPATINE, Nevertheless their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.,Revenge of the Sith
4886,ANAKIN, For what? I don't understand.,Revenge of the Sith
4887,PALPATINE, To be the eyes ears and voice of the Republic . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4889,PALPATINE,  Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
4890,ANAKIN, Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed sir but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.,Revenge of the Sith
4891,PALPATINE, I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.,Revenge of the Sith
4894,BAIL ORGANA, Now that he has control of the Jedi Council the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
4895,FANG ZAR, When did this happen?,Revenge of the Sith
4896,BAIL ORGANA, The decree was posted this morning.,Revenge of the Sith
4897,PADME, Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?,Revenge of the Sith
4898,MON MOTHMA, Why bother? As a practical matter the Senate no longer exists.,Revenge of the Sith
4899,GIDDEAN DANU, The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives sometimes a dozen in one day.,Revenge of the Sith
4900,BAIL ORGANA, We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.,Revenge of the Sith
4902,TERR TANEEL, What are you suggesting?,Revenge of the Sith
4903,BAIL ORGANA, I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.,Revenge of the Sith
4904,MON MOTHMA, We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
4905,BAIL ORGANA, It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.,Revenge of the Sith
4906,PADME, I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.,Revenge of the Sith
4907,GlDDEAN DANU, Senator I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.,Revenge of the Sith
4908,MON MOTHMA, The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.,Revenge of the Sith
4909,BAIL ORGANA, We can't sit around debating any longer we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4910,PADME, Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point it's better to leave some things unsaid.,Revenge of the Sith
4911,BAIL ORGANA, Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone without everyone in this group agreeing.,Revenge of the Sith
4912,MON MOTHMA, That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.,Revenge of the Sith
4914,PADME, Agreed.,Revenge of the Sith
4919,MACE, Anakin Skywalker we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.,Revenge of the Sith
4920,ANAKIN, I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.,Revenge of the Sith
4921,YODA, Allow this appointment lightly the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.,Revenge of the Sith
4922,ANAKIN, I understand.,Revenge of the Sith
4923,MACE, You are on this Council but we do not grant you the rank of Master.,Revenge of the Sith
4925,ANAKIN, What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?,Revenge of the Sith
4926,MACE, Take a seat young Skywalker.,Revenge of the Sith
4927,ANAKIN, Forgive me Master.,Revenge of the Sith
4929,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, We have surveyed all systems in the Republic and have found no sign of General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
4930,YODA, Hiding in the Outer Rim Grievous is. The outlying systems you must sweep.,Revenge of the Sith
4931,OBI-WAN, It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.,Revenge of the Sith
4932,MACE, We cannot take ships from the front line.,Revenge of the Sith
4933,OBI-WAN, And yet it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.,Revenge of the Sith
4934,YODA, Master Kenobi our spies contact you must and then wait.,Revenge of the Sith
4935,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?,Revenge of the Sith
4936,MACE, It is critical we send an attack group there immediately!,Revenge of the Sith
4937,OBI-WAN, He's right that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.,Revenge of the Sith
4938,ANAKIN, I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.,Revenge of the Sith
4939,MACE, Skywalker your assignment is here with the Chancellor and Kenobi must find General Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
4940,YODA, Go I will. Good relations with the Wookiees I have.,Revenge of the Sith
4941,MACE, It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.,Revenge of the Sith
4945,ANAKIN, What kind of nonsense is this put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!,Revenge of the Sith
4946,OBI-WAN, Calm down Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.,Revenge of the Sith
4947,ANAKIN, I swear to you I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4948,OBI-WAN, But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.,Revenge of the Sith
4949,ANAKIN, That has nothing to do with this.,Revenge of the Sith
4950,OBI-WAN, Anakin regardless of how it happened you find yourself in a delicate situation.,Revenge of the Sith
4951,ANAKIN, You mean divided loyalties.,Revenge of the Sith
4952,OBI-WAN, I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.,Revenge of the Sith
4953,ANAKIN, The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.,Revenge of the Sith
4954,OBI-WAN, No it is not. Anakin I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous dark thoughts.,Revenge of the Sith
4955,ANAKIN, Master you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.,Revenge of the Sith
4956,OBI-WAN, I hope so . . .,Revenge of the Sith
4957,ANAKIN, I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.,Revenge of the Sith
4958,OBI-WAN, Anakin the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.,Revenge of the Sith
4959,ANAKIN, And?,Revenge of the Sith
4960,OBI-WAN, Anakin look I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.,Revenge of the Sith
4961,ANAKIN, What situation?,Revenge of the Sith
4962,OBI-WAN,  The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.,Revenge of the Sith
4963,ANAKIN, They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!,Revenge of the Sith
4964,OBI-WAN, We are at war Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic even if the Chancellor does not.,Revenge of the Sith
4965,ANAKIN, Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?,Revenge of the Sith
4966,OBI-WAN, This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.,Revenge of the Sith
4967,ANAKIN, The Chancellor is not a bad man Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.,Revenge of the Sith
4968,OBI-WAN, That is why you must help us Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.,Revenge of the Sith
4969,ANAKIN, Master the Senate demanded that he stay longer.,Revenge of the Sith
4970,OBI-WAN, Yes but use your feelings Anakin. Something is out of place.,Revenge of the Sith
4971,ANAKIN, You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?,Revenge of the Sith
4972,OBI-WAN, The Council is asking you.,Revenge of the Sith
4977,OBI-WAN, Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.,Revenge of the Sith
4978,YODA, Too much under the sway of the Chancellor he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.,Revenge of the Sith
4979,MACE, It's very dangerous putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.,Revenge of the Sith
4980,OBI-WAN, He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.,Revenge of the Sith
4981,MACE,I wish I did.,Revenge of the Sith
4982,OBI-WAN, With all due respect Master is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?,Revenge of the Sith
4983,MACE, So the prophecy says.,Revenge of the Sith
4984,YODA, A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.,Revenge of the Sith
4985,OBI-WAN, He will not let me down. He never has.,Revenge of the Sith
4986,YODA, I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk I will. May the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith
4990,PADME, Thank you Captain.,Revenge of the Sith
4991,CAPTAIN TYPHO, Rest well. My Lady.,Revenge of the Sith
4993,PADME, I'll be up in a while.,Revenge of the Sith
4994,MOTEE, Yes my lady.,Revenge of the Sith
4996,C-3PO, Is there anything I might do for you my lady?,Revenge of the Sith
4997,PADME, Yes make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you Threepio.,Revenge of the Sith
5000,ANAKIN, Beautiful isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
5002,PADME, You startled me.,Revenge of the Sith
5004,ANAKIN, How are you feeling?,Revenge of the Sith
5005,PADME, He keeps kicking.,Revenge of the Sith
5006,ANAKIN, He?! Why do you think it's a boy?,Revenge of the Sith
5007,PADME,  My motherly intuition.,Revenge of the Sith
5009,ANAKIN, Whoa! With a kick that strong it's got to be a girl.,Revenge of the Sith
5011,PADME, I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.,Revenge of the Sith
5012,ANAKIN, I may be on the Council but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.,Revenge of the Sith
5013,PADME, Patience. In time they will recognize your skills.,Revenge of the Sith
5014,ANAKIN, They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power that's the problem.,Revenge of the Sith
5015,PADME, Anakin . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5016,ANAKIN, Sometimes I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.,Revenge of the Sith
5017,PADME, Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?,Revenge of the Sith
5018,ANAKIN,  What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
5019,PADME, What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?,Revenge of the Sith
5020,ANAKIN, I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!,Revenge of the Sith
5021,PADME, Anakin this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.,Revenge of the Sith
5022,ANAKIN,  Don't ask me to do that Padme. Make a motion in the Senate where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!,Revenge of the Sith
5023,PADME, What is it?,Revenge of the Sith
5024,ANAKIN, Nothing.,Revenge of the Sith
5025,PADME, Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.,Revenge of the Sith
5026,ANAKIN, You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.,Revenge of the Sith
5028,ANAKIN,  I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
5030,PADME, I sense there are things you are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
5032,PADME,  Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics no plotting ... no war.,Revenge of the Sith
5035,ANAKIN, You wanted to see me Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
5036,PALPATINE, Yes Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.,Revenge of the Sith
5037,ANAKIN, At last we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.,Revenge of the Sith
5038,PALPATINE, I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far  but they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.,Revenge of the Sith
5039,ANAKIN, They try.,Revenge of the Sith
5040,PALPATINE, Sit down  Leave us.,Revenge of the Sith
5042,PALPATINE,  Anakin you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot they soon will.,Revenge of the Sith
5043,ANAKIN, I'm not sure I understand.,Revenge of the Sith
5044,PALPATINE, You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.,Revenge of the Sith
5045,ANAKIN, I don't think . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5046,PALPATINE, Anakin search your feelings. You know don't you?,Revenge of the Sith
5047,ANAKIN, I know they don't trust you . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5048,PALPATINE, Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.,Revenge of the Sith
5049,ANAKIN, I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.,Revenge of the Sith
5050,PALPATINE, Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest didn't they?,Revenge of the Sith
5052,PALPATINE,  They asked you to spy on me didn't they?,Revenge of the Sith
5053,ANAKIN, I don't know ... I don't know what to say.,Revenge of the Sith
5054,PALPATINE," Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. ""All those who gain power are afraid to lose it."" Even the Jedi.",Revenge of the Sith
5055,ANAKIN, The Jedi use their power for good.,Revenge of the Sith
5056,PALPATINE, Good is a point of view Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .,Revenge of the Sith
5057,ANAKIN, . . . evil.,Revenge of the Sith
5058,PALPATINE, . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.,Revenge of the Sith
5059,ANAKIN, The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward only about themselves.,Revenge of the Sith
5060,PALPATINE, And the Jedi don't?,Revenge of the Sith
5061,ANAKIN, The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.,Revenge of the Sith
5063,PALPATINE, Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it then that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?,Revenge of the Sith
5064,ANAKIN, I'm not sure it's wrong.,Revenge of the Sith
5065,PALPATINE, Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.,Revenge of the Sith
5067,PALPATINE,"  Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis ""the wise""?",Revenge of the Sith
5068,ANAKIN, No.,Revenge of the Sith
5069,PALPATINE, I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.,Revenge of the Sith
5070,ANAKIN, He could actually save people from death?,Revenge of the Sith
5071,PALPATINE, The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.,Revenge of the Sith
5072,ANAKIN, What happened to him?,Revenge of the Sith
5073,PALPATINE, He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep.  Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death but not himself.,Revenge of the Sith
5074,ANAKIN, Is it possible to learn this power?,Revenge of the Sith
5075,PALPATINE, Not from a Jedi.,Revenge of the Sith
5080,Kl-ADI-MUNDI,  Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.,Revenge of the Sith
5081,MACE,  How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.,Revenge of the Sith
5082,ANAKIN, A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.,Revenge of the Sith
5083,YODA, Act on this we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.,Revenge of the Sith
5084,OBI-WAN, Does everyone agree?,Revenge of the Sith
5086,ANAKIN, The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.,Revenge of the Sith
5088,MACE,  The Council will make up its own mind who is to go not the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
5089,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, Yes this decision is ours to make.,Revenge of the Sith
5091,YODA, A Master is needed with more experience.,Revenge of the Sith
5092,MACE, Given our resources I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.,Revenge of the Sith
5093,ANAKIN, He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.,Revenge of the Sith
5095,ANAKIN,  No offense my Master but I'm only stating a fact.,Revenge of the Sith
5096,OBI-WAN, Oh no you're quite right but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.,Revenge of the Sith
5097,YODA, Obi-Wan my choice is.,Revenge of the Sith
5098,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, I concur. Master Kenobi should go.,Revenge of the Sith
5099,YODA, I agree.,Revenge of the Sith
5101,MACE, Very well. Council is adjourned.,Revenge of the Sith
5103,MACE,  Obi-Wan prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.,Revenge of the Sith
5106,CLONE COMMANDER GREE, The droids have started up their main power generators.,Revenge of the Sith
5107,YODA, Then now the time is Commander.,Revenge of the Sith
5108,CLONE COMMANDER GREE, Yes sir.,Revenge of the Sith
5116,OBI-WAN, Has Anakin been to see you?,Revenge of the Sith
5117,PADME, Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.,Revenge of the Sith
5118,OBI-WAN, I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient strong willed very opinionated but truly gifted.,Revenge of the Sith
5120,PADME, You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong isn't it?,Revenge of the Sith
5121,OBI-WAN, You should be a Jedi Padme.,Revenge of the Sith
5122,PADME, You're not very good at hiding your feelings.,Revenge of the Sith
5123,OBI-WAN, It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.,Revenge of the Sith
5124,PADME, Why would he talk to me about his work?,Revenge of the Sith
5126,OBI-WAN, Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.,Revenge of the Sith
5127,PADME, Don't give me that look.,Revenge of the Sith
5128,OBI-WAN, I know how he feels about you.,Revenge of the Sith
5129,PADME,  What did he say?,Revenge of the Sith
5130,OBI-WAN, Nothing. He didn't have to.,Revenge of the Sith
5132,PADME, I don't know what you're talking about.,Revenge of the Sith
5133,OBI-WAN, I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme I'm worried about him.,Revenge of the Sith
5135,OBI-WAN,  I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5137,OBI-WAN,  Padme I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends I care about both of you . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5138,PADME, Thank you Obi-Wan.,Revenge of the Sith
5139,OBI-WAN, Please do what you can to help him.,Revenge of the Sith
5142,PADME, We cannot let this turn into another war.,Revenge of the Sith
5143,BAIL ORGANA, Absolutely that is the last thing we want.,Revenge of the Sith
5144,MON MOTHMA, We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution that's all.,Revenge of the Sith
5145,PADME, I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.,Revenge of the Sith
5146,BANA BREEMU, That would be dangerous.,Revenge of the Sith
5147,MON MOTHMA, We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.,Revenge of the Sith
5148,PADME, I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.,Revenge of the Sith
5149,GiDDEAN DANU, Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.,Revenge of the Sith
5150,PADME, The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5151,CHI EEKWAY, Patience Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
5152,FANG ZAR, We have so many Senators on our side surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
5153,BANA BREEMU," When you present the ""petition of the two thousand"" to the Chancellor things may change.",Revenge of the Sith
5154,BAIL ORGANA, Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate before we include the Jedi.,Revenge of the Sith
5158,ANAKIN, You're going to need me on this one Master.,Revenge of the Sith
5159,OBI-WAN, Oh I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.,Revenge of the Sith
5161,ANAKIN, Master!,Revenge of the Sith
5163,ANAKIN,  Master I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.,Revenge of the Sith
5164,OBI-WAN, You are strong and wise Anakin and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.,Revenge of the Sith
5166,OBI-WAN,  Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.,Revenge of the Sith
5167,ANAKIN, Well there's always a first time.,Revenge of the Sith
5170,ANAKIN, Obi-Wan may the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith
5171,OBI-WAN, Good-bye old friend. May the Force be with you.,Revenge of the Sith
5177,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, Fortunately most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.,Revenge of the Sith
5178,OBI-WAN, I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.,Revenge of the Sith
5179,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, Come on boss when have I ever let you down?,Revenge of the Sith
5181,OBI-WAN,  Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.,Revenge of the Sith
5183,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, That was Anakin who was late. I believe.,Revenge of the Sith
5184,OBI-WAN, Very well the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.,Revenge of the Sith
5185,CLONE COMMANDER CODY, I'm counting on you.,Revenge of the Sith
5190,PALPATINE, Well Anakin did you see your friend off?,Revenge of the Sith
5191,ANAKIN, He will soon have Grievous's head.,Revenge of the Sith
5192,PALPATINE, We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.,Revenge of the Sith
5193,ANAKIN, The Council was very sure in its decision.,Revenge of the Sith
5197,JAR JAR, Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5199,ANAKIN, Hi Jar Jar.,Revenge of the Sith
5200,JAR JAR, Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry Your Highness sir.,Revenge of the Sith
5202,PALPATINE, There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.,Revenge of the Sith
5203,ANAKIN, Not fit? Why would anyone think that?,Revenge of the Sith
5204,PALPATINE, They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
5205,ANAKIN, That's ridiculous. Who?!?,Revenge of the Sith
5206,PALPATINE,  No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.,Revenge of the Sith
5207,ANAKIN, That's impossible. I would know.,Revenge of the Sith
5208,PALPATINE, Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.,Revenge of the Sith
5210,PALPATINE,  Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.,Revenge of the Sith
5213,OBI-WAN, Save your energy.,Revenge of the Sith
5214,PADME, I can't!,Revenge of the Sith
5215,OBI-WAN, Don't give up Padme. Don't give up . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5218,ANAKIN, I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here hasn't he?,Revenge of the Sith
5219,PADME, He came by this morning.,Revenge of the Sith
5220,ANAKIN, What did he want?,Revenge of the Sith
5222,PADME, He's worried about you.,Revenge of the Sith
5223,ANAKIN, You told him about us didn't you?,Revenge of the Sith
5225,PADME, He's your best friend Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.,Revenge of the Sith

5330,ANAKIN, What do you mean?,Revenge of the Sith
5331,PALPATINE, They are not to be trusted.,Revenge of the Sith
5332,ANAKIN, Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5333,PALPATINE, These are unstable times for the Republic Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.,Revenge of the Sith
5334,ANAKIN, I'm sure you're mistaken.,Revenge of the Sith
5335,PALPATINE, I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.,Revenge of the Sith

intentions.",Revenge of the Sith
5343,ANAKIN, Yes Master.,Revenge of the Sith
5345,MACE WINDU, I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.,Revenge of the Sith
5346,Kl-ADI-MUNDI," If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous then he should be removed from
office.",Revenge of the Sith
5347,MACE WiNDU, That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .,Revenge of the Sith
5348,Kl-ADI-MUNDI, . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.,Revenge of the Sith

5354,ANAKIN, I should be there with him.,Revenge of the Sith
5355,PALPATINE, It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?,Revenge of the Sith
5356,ANAKIN, I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.,Revenge of the Sith
5357,PALPATINE, They don't trust you Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.,Revenge of the Sith

5362,ANAKIN, You know the dark side?!?,Revenge of the Sith
5363,PALPATINE, Anakin if one is to understand the great mystery one must study all its aspects not just the dogmatic narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi Anakin.  They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.,Revenge of the Sith
5364,ANAKIN, I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.,Revenge of the Sith
5365,PALPATINE, Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force Anakin and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.,Revenge of the Sith
