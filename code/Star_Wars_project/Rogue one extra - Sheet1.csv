LYRA,Saw it's Lyra.It's happened. He's come for us. 
STORMTROOPER,Get out of the way. Move! Move!
BODHI,Is that him?He looks kind of different than I imagined. 
GENERAL DRAVEN,You're currently calling yourself Liana Hallik. Is that correct? Possession of unsanctioned weapons forgery of Imperial documents aggravated assaultescape from custody resisting arrest Imagine if the Imperial authorities had found out who you really were. Jyn Erso? That's your given name is it not? Jyn Erso? Daughter of Galen Erso. A known Imperial collaborator in weapons development. 
CASSIAN,He'd remember you though wouldn't he? He might agree to meet you if you came as a friend. 
CASSIAN,There's an Imperial defector in Jedha. A pilot. He's being held by Saw Gerrera. He's claiming the Emperor is creating a weapon with the power to destroy entire planets. The pilot says he was sent by your father. 
GALEN,What's the matter Jyn? You looked frightened.I'll always protect you. Stardust. Don't ever change. 
CASSIAN,It's 'what are they taking out?' Kyber crystal. All they can get. We wondered why they were stripping the temple now we know.It's the fuel for the weapon. 
CITIZEN,Quickly the kyber get it. Here take the kyber. Take the kyber.Come on! 
STORMTROOPER,He's blind. 
CHIRRUT,Can't you see we are no friends of the Empire?
JYN ERSO,Anyone who kills me or my friends will answer to Saw Gerrera. 
BAZE,He's praying for the door to open. 
TARKIN,That won't be necessary. We need a statement not a manifesto. The Holy City will be enough for the day. 
BAZE,Chirrut let's go! 
KRENNIC,That was only an inkling of it's destructive potential. 
JYN,That's ridiculous. We all got the message.Everyone here knows it. 
BODHI,This way. 
KRENNIC,Jedha. Saw Gerrera.His band of fanatics. Their Holy City. The last reminder of the Jedi. Gone. 
DRAVEN,To lure our forces into a final battle. To destroy us once and for all.
REBEL,Yes. 
CASSIAN,But I do. I believe you.We'd like to volunteer. Some of us... ... most of us we've done terrible things on behalf of the Rebellion. We're spies. Saboteurs. Assassins. Everything I did I did for the Rebellion. And every time I walked away from something I wanted to forget I told myself it was for a cause that I believed in. A cause that was worth it. Without that we're lost.Everything we've done would have been for nothing. I couldn't face myself if I gave up now. of us could. It won't be comfortable. 
BODHI,Or stolen.
K2-SO,Impressive.
INSPECTOR,That would be helpful. 
BLUE LEADER,Stop right there Private. 
REBEL,Intercepted Imperial transmission ma'am. Rebels on Scarif. 
CHIRRUT,Run! 
BLUE EIGHT,We won't have long. 
BODHI,They closed the shield gate we're stuck here. But the rebel fleet is pulling in.We just have to get a signal strong enough to get through to them and let them know we're trapped down here. For that we have to connect to the communications tower. Now I can patch us in over here the landing pad but you have to get on the radio get one of the guys out there to find a master switch. Get them to activate the connection between us and that comm tower. 
TONC,Melshi. Melshi come in are you there? Bodhi will send a signal from here. He's patching us in.But you guys have to open up a line for the tower. 
MELSHI,Master switch describe what are we looking for? 
RED PILOT,We have no effect on that shield. 
TARKIN,Lord Vader will handle the fleet. Target the base at Scarif. Single reactor ignition. 
SAW,You know what to do.
CASSIAN,Calm down.Calm down. We'll be all right.
MILITIA,(On your feet! It's the pilot the defector) 
BODHI,Okay so you're-you're Saw Gerrera? Saw Gerrera. No? Okay we're just wasting time that we don't have. I need to speak to Saw Gerrera! I keep telling them before before it's too late. 
BODHI,We're out here in the middle of nowhere.We need to get to Jedha City.What part of urgent message do you guys not understand? Hey! we're all on the same side if you just see past the uniform for a minute. I've got to speak to ah... I've got to speak to Saw Gerrera.
JYN ERSO,What is this? 
MON MOTHMA,It's a chance for you to make a fresh start.
DRAVEN:,We're up against the clock here girl So if there's nothing to talk about we'll just put you back where we found you.
MON MOTHMA:,We need to stop this weapon before it is finished. 
DRAVEN:,Captain Andor's mission is to authenticate the pilot's story and then if possible find your father. 
MON MOTHMA:,It appears he is critical to the development of this superweapon. Given the gravity of the situation and your history with Sawwe're hoping that he will help us locate your father and return him to the Senate for testimony.
LYRA:,Trust...
K2-SO: ,The weapon your father's building.
CASSIAN:,This way!
STORMTROOPER: ,Is he deaf?
MILITIA: ,(Tell that to the one who killed our men.)
MILITIA: ,(And why Is that?)
JYN ERSO:,Because I am the daughter of Galen Erso.
MILITIA:,(Take them!)
CHIRRUT:,It bothers him because he knows it is possible. Baze Malbus was once the most devoted Guardian of us all.
KRENNIC:,Target Jedha City prepare single reactor ignition.
CASSIAN:,Come on! Let's get out of here!
TARKIN:,I will tell him that I will be taking control over the weapon I first spoke of years ago effective immediately.
K2-SO:,One blast to the reactor module and the whole system goes down. That's how you said it. The whole system goes down.
CASSIAN:,I'll be right behind you. Come on.
GALEN:,You'll never win.
VASPAR:,To risk everything based on what? The testimony of a criminal? The dying words of her father an Imperial scientist?
JYN:,Every moment you waste is another step closer to the ashes of Jedha.
BODHI:,It'll be a bit cramped but we'll all fit. We could go.
JYN:,And if they have?
JYN:,I'll tell the others.
BODHI:,It's just down here.
MON MOTHMA:,Let him speak.
MON MOTHMA:,I need to speak to Admiral Raddus.
SHIELD OFFICER:,Close the field aperture now. Close it!
REBEL:,Retreat. Retreat!
REBEL:,Okay.
MELSHI:,How? Please advise.
TONC:,What does it look like? The master switch? Where is it?
GOLD PILOT:,How much more can that thing take?
ROMODI:,Yes sir.
