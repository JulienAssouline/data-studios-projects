128,TARKIN, Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays and now this. We've heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.,Rogue One,Male,51
129,KRENNIC, When the battle station is finished Governor Tarkin the Senate will be of little concern.,Rogue One,Male,15
130,TARKIN, When has become now Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay you have made time an ally of the Rebellion.

139,K-2SO, Are you talking about me?,Rogue One,Droid,5
140,K-2SO, Are you talking about me?,Rogue One,Droid,5
141,CASSIAN,She's right.We need to blend in. Stay with the ship.,Rogue One,Male,10

145,K-2SO, I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.,Rogue One,Droid,8
146,K-2SO, I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.,Rogue One,Droid,8

150,SAW GERRERA, Bor Gullet can feel your thoughts No lie is safe.What have you really brought me cargo pilot?Bor Gullet will know the truth.The unfortunate side effect is that one tends to lose one's mind.,Rogue One,Male,33

278,BAZE, I'm going to kill him!,Rogue One,Male,5
279,CASSIAN, No no No wait!,Rogue One,Male,4
280,BAZE, Come here!,Rogue One,Male,2
281,CASSIAN, NO!,Rogue One,Male,1
282,BAZE, Back off. Back off.,Rogue One,Male,4
283,CASSIAN, Okay.,Rogue One,Male,1
284,CASSIAN, Are you the pilot? Hey heyare you the pilot? The shuttle pilot? Pilot?,Rogue One,Male,13
285,CHIRRUT, What's wrong with him?,Rogue One,Male,4
286,CASSIAN,Galen Erso. You know that name?,Rogue One,Male,6
287,BODHI, I brought the message I'm the pilot.I'm the pilot. I'm the pilot.,Rogue One,Male,12
288,CASSIAN, Okay good. Now where is Galen Erso?,Rogue One,Male,7
289,OFFICER, Standby.,Rogue One,Male,1
290,SAW GERRERA, This is the message I was sent.,Rogue One,Male,7
291,GALEN ERSO, Saw if you're watching this then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance.Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and though I don't dare hope for too much a chance for Jyn if she's alive if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I've missed her. Jyn my Stardust I can't imagine what you think of me. When I was taken I faced some bitter truths. I was told that soon enough Krennic would have you as well. As time went by I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work if I took my own life it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I've placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful they'll never find it. But Jyn. Jyn if you're listening My beloved so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It's just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw the reactor module that's the key. That's the place I've laid my trap. It's well hidden and unstable one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station. You'll need the plans the structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know there's a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station...,Rogue One,Male,385
292,CASSIAN, Go. Go.,Rogue One,Male,2
293,CASSIAN, K-2? K-2 where are you?,Rogue One,Male,5
294,K-2SO, There you are. I'm standing by as you requested. Although there's a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.,Rogue One,Droid,20

314,K-2SO, I'm not very optimistic about our odds.,Rogue One,Droid,7
315,CASSIAN, Let's not K. Come on! Punch it.,Rogue One,Male,7
316,K-2SO,I haven't completed my calculation.,Rogue One,Droid,5
317,K-2SO,I haven't completed my calculation.,Rogue One,Droid,5
318,CASSIAN, I'll make them for you.,Rogue One,Male,5
319,TARKIN,I believe I owe you an apology Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations.,Rogue One,Male,14
320,KRENNIC, And you'll tell the Emperor as much?,Rogue One,Male,7
321,TARKIN, I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.,Rogue One,Male,24
322,KRENNIC, We stand here amid my achievement not yours!,Rogue One,Male,8
323,TARKIN,I'm afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.,Rogue One,Male,15
324,KRENNIC, The breaches have been filled Jedha has been silenced.,Rogue One,Male,9
325,TARKIN,You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso's facility.,Rogue One,Male,17
326,KRENNIC, We'll see about this.,Rogue One,Male,4
327,REBEL, A coded message from Captain Andor sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise.,Rogue One,Male,18
328,GENERAL DRAVEN, Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.,Rogue One,,41
329,CHIRRUT, Baze tell me. All of it? The whole city?Tell me.,Rogue One,Male,10
330,BODHI, All of it.,Rogue One,Male,3

336,BODHI, So you're Galen's daughter.,Rogue One,Male,4
337,JYN ERSO, You know him?,Rogue One,Female,3
338,BODHI, I'm Bodhi the pilot.,Rogue One,Male,4
339,JYN ERSO, You brought the message.,Rogue One,Female,4
340,BODHI, Yes your father... He said I could get right by myself.He said I could make it right if I was brave enough and listened to what was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late.,Rogue One,Male,39
341,JYN ERSO, It wasn't too late.,Rogue One,Female,4
342,BODHI, Seems pretty late to me.,Rogue One,Male,5
343,JYN ERSO, No. We can beat the people who did this. My father's message I've seen it.They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there's a way to defeat it. You're wrong about my father.,Rogue One,Female,36
344,CASSIAN, He did build it.,Rogue One,Male,4
345,JYN ERSO, Because he knew they'd do it without him. My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He's rigged a trap inside it.That's why he sent you. To bring that message.,Rogue One,Female,33
346,CASSIAN, Where is it? Where's the message?,Rogue One,Male,6
347,JYN ERSO, It was a hologram.,Rogue One,Female,4
348,CASSIAN, You have that message right?,Rogue One,Male,5
349,JYN ERSO, Everything happened so fast.,Rogue One,Female,4
350,CASSIAN, Did you see it?,Rogue One,Male,4
351,JYN ERSO, You don't believe me.,Rogue One,Female,4
352,CASSIAN, I'm not the one you've got to convince.,Rogue One,Male,8
353,CHIRRUT, I believe her.,Rogue One,Male,3
354,CASSIAN, That's good to know.,Rogue One,Male,4
355,BAZE,What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap.,Rogue One,Male,11
356,JYN ERSO, The reactor. He's placed a weakness there. He's been hiding it for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance.,Rogue One,Female,36
357,CASSIAN, I've done that.,Rogue One,Male,3
358,JYN ERSO, They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing. They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.,Rogue One,Female,21
359,CASSIAN, I can't risk sending that. We're in the heart of Imperial territory.,Rogue One,Male,12
360,JYN ERSO,Then we'll find him. And bring him back and he can tell them himself.,Rogue One,Female,14

392,CASSIAN, Yeah. Where is it?,Rogue One,Male,4
393,BODHI, It's just over the ridge.,Rogue One,Male,5
394,CASSIAN, And that's a shuttle depot straight ahead of us? You are sure of that?,Rogue One,Male,14
395,BODHI, Yes.We'll have to hope there's still an Imperial ship left to steal. ,Rogue One,Male,12
396,CASSIAN, Here's what we're doing. Hopefully the storm keeps up and keeps us hidden down here.Bodhi you're coming with me. We'll go up the ridge and check it out.,Rogue One,Male,28

487,JYN ERSO, Deny it.,Rogue One,Female,2
488,CASSIAN, You're in shock and looking for someplace to put it.,Rogue One,Male,10
489,JYN ERSO, I've seen it before.,Rogue One,Female,4
490,CASSIAN, I bet you have.,Rogue One,Male,4
491,JYN ERSO, They know.You lied about why we came here and you lied about why you went up alone.,Rogue One,Female,17
492,CASSIAN, I had every chance to pull the trigger. But did I? Did I?,Rogue One,Male,13
493,JYN ERSO, You might as well have. My father was living proof and you put him at risk. Those were Alliance bombs that killed him!,Rogue One,Female,23
494,CASSIAN, I had orders! Orders that I disobeyed! But you wouldn't understand that.,Rogue One,Male,12
495,JYN ERSO, Orders?When you know they're wrong? You might as well be a stormtrooper.,Rogue One,Female,12
496,CASSIAN, What do you know? We don't all have the luxury of deciding when and where we want to care about something. Suddenly the Rebellion is real for you? Some of us live it. I've been in this fight since I was 6 years old. You're not the only one who lost everything. Some of us just decided to do something about it.,Rogue One,Male,62
497,JYN ERSO, You can't talk your way around this.,Rogue One,Female,7
498,CASSIAN, I don't have to. Yavin Four! Make sure they know we're coming in with a stolen ship.,Rogue One,Male,17

502,DARTH VADER,You seem unsettled.,Rogue One,Male,3
503,KRENNIC,No. Just pressed for time. There're a great many things to attend to.,Rogue One,Male,13
504,DARTH VADER,My apologies. You do have a great many things to explain.,Rogue One,Male,11
505,KRENNIC,I've delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable… potential.,Rogue One,Male,19
506,DARTH VADER,Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked.,Rogue One,Male,17
507,KRENNIC,It was Governor Tarkin that suggested the test.,Rogue One,Male,8
508,DARTH VADER,You were not summoned here to grovel Director Krennic.,Rogue One,Male,9
509,KRENNIC, No it’s...,Rogue One,Male,2
510,DARTH VADER, There is no Death Star. The Senate has been informed that Jedha was destroyed in a mining disaster.,Rogue One,Male,18
511,KRENNIC,Yes my lord.,Rogue One,Male,3
512,DARTH VADER,I expect you to not rest until you can assure the Emperor that Galen Erso has not compromised this weapon in any way.,Rogue One,Male,23
513,KRENNIC,So I'm still in command? You'll speak to the Emperor about…,Rogue One,Male,11
514,DARTH VADER,Be careful not to choke on your aspirations Director.,Rogue One,Male,9
515,PAMLO, We must scatter the fleet. We have no recourse but to surrender.,Rogue One,Female,12
516,ORGANA, Are we really talking about disbanding something that we've worked so hard to create?,Rogue One,,14
517,RADDUS, We can't just give in.,Rogue One,Male,5
518,VASPAR, We joined an Alliance not a suicide pact!,Rogue One,Male,8
519,ORGANA, We've only now managed to gather our forces.,Rogue One,,8
520,JEBEL, Gather our forces? General Draven's already blown up an Imperial base!,Rogue One,Male,11
521,GENERAL DRAVEN, A decision needed to be made.,Rogue One,,6
522,PAMLO, If it's war you want you'll fight alone!,Rogue One,Female,8
523,VASPAR, If that's the way it's going why have an Alliance at all?,Rogue One,Male,12
524,RADDUS, If she's telling the truth we need to act now!,Rogue One,Male,10
525,MON MOTHMA, Councilors please!,Rogue One,Female,2
526,BLUE LEADER, It is simple the Empire has the means of mass destruction. The Rebellion does not.,Rogue One,Male,15
527,JEBEL, A Death Star this is nonsense.,Rogue One,Male,6
528,JYN ERSO, What reason would my father have to lie? What benefit would it bring him?,Rogue One,Female,14
529,JEBEL, Don't forget the Imperial pilot.,Rogue One,Male,5
530,JYN ERSO, My father gave his life so that we may have a chance to defeat this.,Rogue One,Female,15
531,DODONNA, So you've told us.,Rogue One,Male,4
532,PAMLO, If the Empire has this kind of power what chance do we have?,Rogue One,Female,13
533,JYN ERSO, What chance do we have? The question is 'What choice?' Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now!,Rogue One,Female,46
534,REBEL, What is she proposing?,Rogue One,Male,4
535,REBEL, Just let the girl speak!,Rogue One,Male,5
536,JYN ERSO, Send your best troops to Scarif.Send the whole rebel fleet if you have to. We need to capture the Death Star plans if there is any hope of destroying it.,Rogue One,Female,30
537,PAMLO, You're asking us to invade an Imperial installation based on nothing but hope?,Rogue One,Female,13
538,JYN ERSO, Rebellions are built on hope.,Rogue One,Female,5
539,VASPAR, There is no hope.,Rogue One,Male,4

940,JYN ERSO, You're all rebels aren't you?,Rogue One,Female,5
941,MON MOTHMA, Yes but Saw Gerrera's an extremist. He's been fighting on his own since he broke with the Rebellion. His militancy has caused the Alliance a great many problems. We have no choice now but to try to mend that broken trust.,Rogue One,Female,41

968,JYN ERSO, Trust goes both ways.,Rogue One,Female,4
969,K-2SO, You're letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It's high.,Rogue One,Droid,20
970,K-2SO, You're letting her keep it? Would you like to know the probability of her using it against you? It's high.,Rogue One,Droid,20
971,CASSIAN, Let's get going.,Rogue One,Male,3

982,BODHI, Bor Gullet? Galen Erso sent me! He told me to find you!,Rogue One,Male,12
983,TARKIN, Most unfortunate about the security breach on Jedha Director Krennic. After so many setbacks and delays and now this. We've heard word of rumors circulating through the city. Apparently you've lost a rather talkative cargo pilot. If the Senate gets wind of our project countless systems will flock to the Rebellion.,Rogue One,Male,51
984,KRENNIC, When the battle station is finished Governor Tarkin the Senate will be of little concern.,Rogue One,Male,15
985,TARKIN, When has become now Director Krennic. The Emperor will tolerate no further delay you have made time an ally of the Rebellion. I suggest we solve both problems simultaneously with an immediate test of the weapon. Failure will find you explaining why to a far less patient audience.,Rogue One,Male,48
986,KRENNIC,I will not fail.,Rogue One,Male,4

992,JYN ERSO,What are they bringing in?,Rogue One,Female,5
993,JYN ERSO, Maybe we should leave target practice behind.,Rogue One,Female,7
994,K-2SO, Are you talking about me?,Rogue One,Droid,5
995,K-2SO, Are you talking about me?,Rogue One,Droid,5
996,CASSIAN,She's right.We need to blend in. Stay with the ship.,Rogue One,Male,10

998,K-2SO, I can blend in. I'm an Imperial droid. This city is under Imperial occupation,Rogue One,Droid,14

1000,K-2SO, I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.,Rogue One,Droid,8
1001,K-2SO, I'm surprised you're so concerned with my safety.,Rogue One,Droid,8

1108,JYN ERSO, You dumped me!,Rogue One,Female,3
1109,SAW GERRERA, You were the daughter of an Imperial science officer! People were starting to figure that out. People who wanted to- to use you as a hostage. Not a day goes by that I don't think of you. But today of all days? It's a trap isn't it?,Rogue One,Male,47
1110,JYN ERSO, What?,Rogue One,Female,1
1111,SAW GERRERA, The pilot! The message. All of it. Did they... send you? Did you come here to kill me? There's not much of me left.,Rogue One,Male,24
1112,JYN ERSO, The Alliance wants my father.They think he's sent you a message about a weapon. I guess they think by sending me you might actually help them out.,Rogue One,Female,27
1113,SAW GERRERA, So what is it that you want Jyn?,Rogue One,Male,8
1114,JYN ERSO, They wanted an introduction they've got it. I'm out now. The rest of you can do what you want.,Rogue One,Female,19

1121,KRENNIC, One had hoped that he and Lord Vader might have been here for such an occasion.,Rogue One,Male,16
1122,TARKIN, And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.,Rogue One,Male,12
1123,KRENNIC,Your concern is hardly warranted.,Rogue One,Male,5
1124,TARKIN, If saying it would only make it so.,Rogue One,Male,8

1143,CASSIAN, Okay good. Now where is Galen Erso?,Rogue One,Male,7
1144,OFFICER, Standby.,Rogue One,Male,1
1145,SAW GERRERA, This is the message I was sent.,Rogue One,Male,7
1146,GALEN ERSO, Saw if you're watching this then perhaps there is a chance to save the Alliance.Perhaps there's a chance to explain myself and though I don't dare hope for too much a chance for Jyn if she's alive if you can possibly find her to let her know that my love for her has never faded and how desperately I've missed her. Jyn my Stardust I can't imagine what you think of me. When I was taken I faced some bitter truths. I was told that soon enough Krennic would have you as well. As time went by I knew that you were either dead or so well hidden that he would never find you. I knew if I refused to work if I took my own life it would only be a matter of time before Krennic realized he no longer needed me to complete the project. So I did the one thing that nobody expected: I lied. I learned to lie. I played the part of a beaten man resigned to the sanctuary of his work. I made myself indispensable and all the while I laid the groundwork of my revenge. We call it the Death Star. There is no better name. And the day is coming soon when it will be unleashed. I've placed a weakness deep within the system. A flaw so small and powerful they'll never find it. But Jyn. Jyn if you're listening My beloved so much of my life has been wasted. I try to think of you only in the moments when I'm strong because the pain of not having you with me Your mother. Our family. The pain of that loss is so overwhelming I risk failing even now. It's just so hard not to think of you. Think of where you are. My Stardust. Saw the reactor module that's the key. That's the place I've laid my trap. It's well hidden and unstable one blast to any part of it will destroy the entire station. You'll need the plans the structural plans for the Death Star to find the reactor. I know there's a complete engineering archive in the data vault at the Citadel Tower on Scarif. Any pressurized explosion to the reactor module will set off a chain reaction that will destroy the entire station...,Rogue One,Male,385
1147,CASSIAN, Go. Go.,Rogue One,Male,2
1148,CASSIAN, K-2? K-2 where are you?,Rogue One,Male,5
1149,K-2SO, There you are. I'm standing by as you requested. Although there's a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.,Rogue One,Droid,20
1150,K-2SO, There you are. I'm standing by as you requested. Although there's a problem on the horizon. There is no horizon.,Rogue One,Droid,20
1151,CASSIAN, Locate our position. Bring that ship in here now!,Rogue One,Male,9
1152,CHIRRUT,Where are you going?,Rogue One,Male,4

1167,CASSIAN, Get us out of here! Punch it!,Rogue One,Male,7
1168,K-2SO, I'm not very optimistic about our odds.,Rogue One,Droid,7
1169,K-2SO, I'm not very optimistic about our odds.,Rogue One,Droid,7

1171,K-2SO,I haven't completed my calculation.,Rogue One,Droid,5
1172,K-2SO,I haven't completed my calculation.,Rogue One,Droid,5
1173,CASSIAN, I'll make them for you.,Rogue One,Male,5
1174,TARKIN,I believe I owe you an apology Director Krennic. Your work exceeds all expectations.,Rogue One,Male,14
1175,KRENNIC, And you'll tell the Emperor as much?,Rogue One,Male,7
1176,TARKIN, I will tell him his patience with your misadventures has been rewarded with a weapon that will bring a swift end to the Rebellion.,Rogue One,Male,24
1177,KRENNIC, We stand here amid my achievement not yours!,Rogue One,Male,8
1178,TARKIN,I'm afraid these recent security breaches have laid bare your inadequacies as a military director.,Rogue One,Male,15
1179,KRENNIC, The breaches have been filled Jedha has been silenced.,Rogue One,Male,9
1180,TARKIN,You think this pilot acted alone? He was dispatched from the installation on Eadu. Galen Erso's facility.,Rogue One,Male,17
1181,KRENNIC, We'll see about this.,Rogue One,Male,4
1182,REBEL, A coded message from Captain Andor sir. Weapon confirmed. Jedha destroyed. Mission target located on Eadu. Please advise.,Rogue One,Male,18
1183,GENERAL DRAVEN, Destroyed? Proceed. Tell him my orders still stand. Tell him to proceed with haste and keep to the plan. We have no idea what he is building for the Empire. We have to kill Galen Erso while we have the chance.,Rogue One,,41
1184,CHIRRUT, Baze tell me. All of it? The whole city?Tell me.,Rogue One,Male,10
1185,BODHI, All of it.,Rogue One,Male,3
1186,CASSIAN, Understood. Set a course for Eadu.,Rogue One,Male,6

1191,BODHI, So you're Galen's daughter.,Rogue One,Male,4
1192,JYN ERSO, You know him?,Rogue One,Female,3
1193,BODHI, I'm Bodhi the pilot.,Rogue One,Male,4
1194,JYN ERSO, You brought the message.,Rogue One,Female,4
1195,BODHI, Yes your father... He said I could get right by myself.He said I could make it right if I was brave enough and listened to what was in my heart. Do something about it. Guess it was too late.,Rogue One,Male,39
1196,JYN ERSO, It wasn't too late.,Rogue One,Female,4
1197,BODHI, Seems pretty late to me.,Rogue One,Male,5
1198,JYN ERSO, No. We can beat the people who did this. My father's message I've seen it.They call it the Death Star. But they have no idea there's a way to defeat it. You're wrong about my father.,Rogue One,Female,36
1199,CASSIAN, He did build it.,Rogue One,Male,4
1200,JYN ERSO, Because he knew they'd do it without him. My father made a choice. He sacrificed himself for the Rebellion. He's rigged a trap inside it.That's why he sent you. To bring that message.,Rogue One,Female,33
1201,CASSIAN, Where is it? Where's the message?,Rogue One,Male,6
1202,JYN ERSO, It was a hologram.,Rogue One,Female,4
1203,CASSIAN, You have that message right?,Rogue One,Male,5

1206,JYN ERSO, You don't believe me.,Rogue One,Female,4
1207,CASSIAN, I'm not the one you've got to convince.,Rogue One,Male,8
1208,CHIRRUT, I believe her.,Rogue One,Male,3
1209,CASSIAN, That's good to know.,Rogue One,Male,4
1210,BAZE,What kind of trap? You said your father made a trap.,Rogue One,Male,11
1211,JYN ERSO, The reactor. He's placed a weakness there. He's been hiding it for years. He said if you can blow the reactor- the module- the whole system goes down. You need to send word to the Alliance.,Rogue One,Female,36
1212,CASSIAN, I've done that.,Rogue One,Male,3
1213,JYN ERSO, They have to know there's a way to destroy this thing. They have to go to Scarif to get the plans.,Rogue One,Female,21
1214,CASSIAN, I can't risk sending that. We're in the heart of Imperial territory.,Rogue One,Male,12
1215,JYN ERSO,Then we'll find him. And bring him back and he can tell them himself.,Rogue One,Female,14

1360,KRENNIC,I've delivered the weapon the Emperor requested. I deserve an audience to make certain he understands its remarkable… potential.,Rogue One,Male,19
1361,DARTH VADER,Its power to create problems has certainly been confirmed. A city destroyed. An Imperial facility openly attacked.,Rogue One,Male,17

1388,JYN ERSO, What chance do we have? The question is 'What choice?' Run? Hide? Plead for mercy? Scatter your forces? You give way to an enemy this evil with this much power and you condemn the galaxy to an eternity of submission. The time to fight is now!,Rogue One,Female,46
1389,REBEL, What is she proposing?,Rogue One,Male,4
1390,REBEL, Just let the girl speak!,Rogue One,Male,5
