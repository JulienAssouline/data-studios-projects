of laser flack. he skims the surface followed by the droid drop fighter which is followed by anakin.obi-wan fires as he swings across the back of the vulture droids blasting four of them away. anakin heads for a trench along the surface of one of the trade federation battleships. he flies into the trench which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.anakin and obi-wan break right and left and the missiles follow them. anakin does a barrel roll spin causing the missiles following him to collide and explode. two missiles continue to chase obi-wan. he banks sharply to the right then to the left causing one of the missiles to overshoot.anakin moves his ship next to obi-wan's and tries to physically knock the buzz droids off. there are five left. he manages to get one off but badly dents obi-wan's ship in the process. one of the buzz droids tears apiece off of the front of obi-wan's ship. flames burst out and more smoke billows out obscuring the jedi's view.anakin maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors slam shut. obi-wan ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. he jumps dear just as his ship explodes. battle droids rush at him from all directions.general grievous enters the bridge of the trade federation cruiser followed by his two bodyguards. he walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the neimoidian captain.they move toward a second vent. obi-wan is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. anakin feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. he closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening then he moves on. obi-wan is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the super battle droids. it pulls the jedi under the fuel. just before he is about to drown obi-wan disables the super battle droid by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.r2-d2 notices two super battle droids entering the hangar. he moves and hides behind a jedi starfighter.suddenly the elevator plummets down the shaft. anakin quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. he watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. anakin struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as sparking wires rain down on him.anakin looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. he looks at the battle droids leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. he calculates for a moment then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.palpatine makes a small gesture with his hand. obi-wan and anakin turn around. the elevator doors can be heard opening and closing as count dooku strides into the room. he is above the jedi standing on a balcony with two super battle droids. the jedi turn to see him. he looks down on the jedi.as the battle proceeds obi-wan and count dooku are tired. anakin is stronger as he becomes angry. anakin continues to drive the attack on dooku. count dooku throws obi-wan back using the force. anakin and count dooku move up the stairs. as they reach the upper landing of the general's quarters anakin leaps over count dooku. obi-wan reaches the top of the stairs destroying two super battle droids. count dooku holds obi-wan in the air using the force as he turns and kicks anakin out of frame. obi-wan is choking. anakin hits the archway. dooku sends obi-wan flying. the jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. count dooku spins around again and using the force causes a section of the balcony to drop onto obi-wan. anakin spins and kicks count dooku sending him over the balcony. anakin jumps following him down to the main floor. count dooku and anakin continue the fight.anakin and dooku continue their fight. it is intense! finally in one last energized charge anakin cuts off count dooku's hands. the jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed sith lord's hand. count dooku stumbles to the floor as anakin puts the two lightsabers to his neck. palpatine is grinning as he watches count dooku's defeat.the ship begins to list to one side. anakin rushes over to obi-wan lifts the control console from on top of him and pulls him free. he kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. palpatine heads for the elevators.artoo continues to skid and slide toward open space. he swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. one of the battle droids stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. artoo beeps a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the battle droids. one bolt hits very near him and he screams in terror.artoo is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. he falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.as the federation cruiser continues to rotate artoo squeals and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken battle droid parts. he looks around then rockets up out of the debris.anakin and palpatine both look to obi-wan. he shrugs his shoulders. anakin's fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. suddenly the ship turns on its side.obi-wan grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. as he moves out into the hangar two super battle droids start firing at him. the jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the droids blowing them up. anakin and palpatine follow obi-wan along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. palpatine struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. palpatine loses his grip as a pipe breaks causing a rush of steam but anakin manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the chancellor dangles on the other end of the utility cable. they are surrounded by sparks and explosions as the ship twists and tries to break apart. anakin moves out of the steam and struggles to pull palpatine back to safety. anakin is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. the ceiling behind them buckles causing pipes to break creating geysers of steam. some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. they make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.artoo comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. he takes a moment to compose himself.artoo creates a distraction by extending all his arms shooting out electrical pulses and bouncing around. obi-wan hands restrained with electrobonds spins around reaches out and using the force yanks his lightsaber out of the general's hand ignites it and cuts his bonds. he continues to spin around and cuts anakin free.obi-wan fights one of general grievous's bodyguards. the bodyguard carries an electrified staff about five feet long. when the laser sword hits it electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. obi-wan is unable to cut the staff. the jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge. obi-wan pulls himself together and attacks again cutting off the droid bodyguard's head. the droid bodyguard keeps attacking. anakin struggles to defend himself against the other manic droid bodyguard. he cuts the droid bodyguard in half. two battle droids try to take the chancellor away. anakin follows them down the hallway and cuts them down rescuing the chancellor. obi-wan finishes off the headless bodyguard. it crumbles to the floor in pieces. alarms sound as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. a pilot yells at general grievous.obi-wan tries to get at general grievous. anakin runs at the general from the opposing side. general grievous turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. it breaks causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. general grievous is the first one sucked out into space. he fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. he swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship. obi-wan anakin and palpatine hold on for dear life. a blast shield closes around where the window used to be.obi-wan continues to fight the battle droids. the droids have backed him into a corner. obi-wan hides behind a control panel as the droids blast away at him. he jumps up and over the droids cutting most of them down before he lands. he destroys the droids and joins anakin. anakin and obi-wan cut through the rest of the droids as if they were made of butter. palpatine stands in shock as he watches the carnage. droid parts are firing everywhere. obi-wan and anakin stand back to back and cut down the last of the droids just as there is a huge shudder followed by more alarms. sparks begin to fly outside the windows.general grievous detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the federation cruiser using his magnetized hands and feet. he reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.he gets in one the hatch closes and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged cruiser.anakin starts to give her another kiss. she steps back.he grabs her again.anakin is stunned. he thinks through all of the ramifications of this. he takes her in his arms.general grievous takes the elevator to an upper level. he enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table and bows.the view is strangely distorted and disorienting. padme is on a table in an alien medical chamber. she is giving birth and is screaming.she screams and dies.anakin awakens in a panic. he is covered in sweat. he looks over in the bed and sees padme sound asleep next to him. anakin gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. he is breathing heavily. he puts his head in his hands and weeps. he regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. padme awakens realizes anakin is gone.she gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.anakin walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. the vast city planet of coruscant smoldering from the battle is spread out before him. he is distraught. padme descends the stairs and joins anakin on the veranda. she takes his hand. he doesn't look at her.anakin touches the japor snippet around padme's neck that anakin gave her when he was a small boy.anakin rushes into the briefing room. by the time he reaches the chamber the last of the jedi are leaving. only obi-wan remains at the front of the lecture hall. he is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.anakin enters and stands in the middle of the room. he is surrounded by the jedi council mace windu eeth koth obi-wan yoda the holograms of plo koon and ki-adi-mundi.padme stands and watches the sunset. the shadowy figure moves toward her. she senses something.he sits next to her on the bench.she puts his hand on her belly.anakin doesn't

into the hyperspace ring. he heads for the planet utapau.anakin is in the living room working. he sits on the couch where obi-wan was sitting. padme enters and crosses behind him.she continues to walk to the bedroom he follows.obi-wan also watches his ship take off. he is hiding in the hallway. he quietly moves farther into the city.obi-wan quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. it's hard to see him. in an alcove he carefully surveys the city then quickly moves on.obi-wan makes his way through the city looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. he tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. he hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates. he comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen dragon-like lizards. several wranglers are standing around. obi-wan walks up to the wranglers and uses the force with his slight hand movements.one of the wranglers turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. obi-wan walks along the line of dragon/lizards checking out each one. he looks at their teeth legs etc. finally he pats one on the neck.twenty clones suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center ray guns blazing. chaos. laser bolts fly everywhere as the droids return fire. obi-wan attacks general grievous who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. obi-wan uses the force to hurl general grievous backwards. he falls onto a lower platform and obi-wan jumps down after him.more clones rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining droids. the jedi cuts down several droids as he races to the entrance of the control center. obi-wan spots general grievous racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. general grievous jumps onto a wheel scooter and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. obi-wan whistles for his lizard boga who runs to him. obi-wan jumps on.general grievous lays the scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. obi-wan's lizard breathes hard as she tries to keep up. they destroy droids equipment and clone troops as the jedi and the general cut a swath of destruction through the city.general grievous roars through the stone block tunnel system riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. obi-wan races after the droid his lizard moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. obi-wan catches up with general grievous and they charge through the tunnel side by side. obi-wan grabs the droid's electronic staff.obi-wan charges general grievous swinging the staff and hitting the droid in the stomach knocking the gun away. general grievous is hit by the staff and the force bends his forearm. he pulls obi-wan close to him and they engage in a furious fight. the electro-staff is knocked away. the two engage in hand-to-hand combat. obi-wan struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal unstoppable droid.general grievous's stomachplate is loose. obi-wan grabs it and rips it off revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the droid's chest. general grievous grabs obi-wan hoists him over his head and tosses him across the platform. obi-wan dangles off the edge of the platform. he clutches the rim trying to hold on. the droid then grabs the staff and charges obi-wan. at the last second obi-wan reaches out his hand and uses the force to retrieve the droid's laser pistol.the jedi fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien droid and he explodes from the inside out. the smoldering droid falls to the ground. obi-wan has killed general grievous. he pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.obi-wan brushes himself off. he throws the pistol onto the platform picks up the electro-staff and jumps on boga. the trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.anakin rushes out of the council chamber and to his speeder. the hangar door opens and he lifts off.palpatine stands a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve and he spins toward the jedi.jedi master mace windu and the sith lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. palpatine is able to use the force to slam mace against the wall but he recovers before the chancellor can cut him down.mace pushes palpatine out to the edge of the ledge. as the jedi moves closer the bolts from palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. the chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. his eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.as mace stares at anakin in shock palpatine springs to life. the full force of palpatine's powerful bolts blasts mace. he attempts to deflect them with his one good hand but the force is too great. as blue rays engulf his body he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. no more screams. no more moans. palpatine lowers his arm.yoda winces closes his eyes and holds his head. he feels a disturbance in the force.he hands obi-wan his lightsaber and the lizard rears up.the battle rages all around obi-wan. droids and clones are everywhere. obi-wan is riding on a lizard

shadows.darth sidious fades and the clone commander snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city where ki-adi-mundi is leading the charge. the clones stop. ki-adi-mundi turns

now the wall. as he moves out into the hangar two super battle droids start firing at him. the jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the droids blowing them up. anakin and palpatine follow obi-wan along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. palpatine struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. palpatine loses his grip as a pipe breaks causing a rush of steam but anakin manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the chancellor dangles on the other end of the utility cable. they are surrounded by sparks and explosions as the ship twists and tries to break apart. anakin moves out of the steam and struggles to pull palpatine back to safety. anakin is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. the ceiling behind them buckles causing pipes to break creating geysers of steam. some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. they make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.artoo comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. he takes a moment to compose himself.artoo creates a distraction by extending all his arms shooting out electrical pulses and bouncing around. obi-wan hands restrained with electrobonds spins around reaches out and using the force yanks his lightsaber out of the general's hand ignites it and cuts his bonds. he continues to spin around and cuts anakin free.obi-wan fights one of general grievous's bodyguards. the bodyguard carries an electrified staff about five feet long. when the laser sword hits it electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. obi-wan is unable to cut the staff. the jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge. obi-wan pulls himself together and attacks again cutting off the droid bodyguard's head. the droid bodyguard keeps attacking. anakin struggles to defend himself against the other manic droid bodyguard. he cuts the droid bodyguard in half. two battle droids try to take the chancellor away. anakin follows them down the hallway and cuts them down rescuing the chancellor. obi-wan finishes off the headless bodyguard. it crumbles to the floor in pieces. alarms sound as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. a pilot yells at general grievous.obi-wan tries to get at general grievous. anakin runs at the general from the opposing side. general grievous turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. it breaks causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. general grievous is the first one sucked out into space. he fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. he swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship. obi-wan anakin and palpatine hold on for dear life. a blast shield closes around where the window used to be.obi-wan continues to fight the battle droids. the droids have backed him into a corner. obi-wan hides behind a control panel as the droids blast away at him. he jumps up and over the droids cutting most of them down before he lands. he destroys the droids and joins anakin. anakin and obi-wan cut through the rest of the droids as if they were made of butter. palpatine stands in shock as he watches the carnage. droid parts are firing everywhere. obi-wan and anakin stand back to back and cut down the last of the droids just as there is a huge shudder followed by more alarms. sparks begin to fly outside the windows.general grievous detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the federation cruiser using his magnetized hands and feet. he reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.he gets in one the hatch closes and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged cruiser.anakin starts to give her

and is screaming.she screams and dies.anakin awakens in a panic. he is covered in sweat. he looks over in the bed and sees padme sound asleep next to him. anakin gets out from under the sheets and

gone.she gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.anakin walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. the vast city planet of coruscant smoldering from the battle is spread out before him. he is distraught. padme descends the stairs and joins anakin on the veranda. she takes his hand. he doesn't look at her.anakin touches the japor snippet around padme's neck that anakin gave her when he was a small boy.anakin rushes into the briefing room. by the time he reaches the chamber the last of the jedi are leaving. only obi-wan remains at the front of the lecture hall. he is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.anakin enters and stands in the middle of the room. he is surrounded by the jedi council mace windu eeth koth obi-wan yoda the holograms of

sinkhole. it's hard to see him. in an alcove he carefully surveys the city then quickly moves on.obi-wan makes his way through the city looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. he tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. he hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates. he comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen dragon-like lizards. several wranglers are standing around. obi-wan walks up to the wranglers and uses the force with his slight hand movements.one of the wranglers turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. obi-wan walks along the line of dragon/lizards checking out each one. he looks at their teeth legs etc. finally he pats one on the neck.twenty clones suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center ray guns blazing. chaos. laser bolts fly everywhere as the droids return fire. obi-wan attacks general grievous who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's

destruction through the city.general grievous roars through the stone block tunnel system riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. obi-wan races after the

droid.general grievous's stomachplate is loose. obi-wan grabs it and rips it off revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the droid's chest. general grievous grabs obi-wan hoists him over his head and tosses him across the platform. obi-wan dangles off the edge of the platform. he clutches the rim trying to hold on. the droid then grabs the staff and charges obi-wan. at the last second obi-wan reaches out his hand and uses the force to retrieve the droid's laser pistol.the jedi fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien droid and he explodes from the inside out.

ledge. as the jedi moves closer the bolts from palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. the chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. his eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.as mace stares at anakin in shock palpatine springs to life. the full force of palpatine's powerful bolts blasts mace. he attempts to deflect them with his one good hand but the force is too
