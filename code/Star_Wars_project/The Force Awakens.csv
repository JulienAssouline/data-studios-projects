1,Lor San Tekka,This will begin to make things right. I've traveled too far and seen too much to ignore the despair in the galaxy. Without the Jedi there can be no balance in the Force.,The Force Awakens

11,Poe Dameron ,Come on BB-8 hurry!,The Force Awakens
13,Poe Dameron ,I see them. You take this. It's safer with you than it is with me. You get as far away from here as you can. Do you hear me?  I'll come back for you. It will be all right.,The Force Awakens

27,Kylo Ren,I'll show you the dark side.,The Force Awakens
29,Lor San Tekka,You may try. But you cannot deny the truth that is your family.,The Force Awakens
31,Kylo Ren,You're so right.,The Force Awakens
33,Poe Dameron ,So who talks first? You talk first? I talk first?,The Force Awakens

65,Unkar,What you brought me today is worth... hmm... one quarter portion.,The Force Awakens
67,Rey,Shh. That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts. He has no respect for anyone. Your antenna's bent. Where do you come from? Classified really? Me too. Big secret. Niima Outpost is that way. Stay off Kelvin Ridge. Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north. You'll drown in the sand. Don't follow me. Town is that way. No! In the morning you go. You're welcome.,The Force Awakens
69,Kylo Ren,I had no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board. Comfortable?,The Force Awakens

115,Poe Dameron ,I've always wanted to fly one of these things. Can you shoot?,The Force Awakens
117,Poe Dameron ,Okay same principle. Use the toggle on the left... to switch between missiles cannons and mag pulse.  Use the sight on the right to aim. Triggers to fire.,The Force Awakens
119,Poe Dameron ,I can fix this.,The Force Awakens
121,Some Guy,We have an unsanctioned departure from bay two. ,The Force Awakens

185,General Hux,They were going back for the droid. Send a squad to the wreckage.,The Force Awakens
187,General Hux,Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit. Capture the droid if we can but destroy it if we must.,The Force Awakens
189,Kylo Ren,How capable are your soldiers General?,The Force Awakens
191,General Hux,I won't have you question my methods.,The Force Awakens
193,Kylo Ren,They're obviously skilled at committing high treason. Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.,The Force Awakens
195,General Hux,My men are exceptionally trained. Programmed from birth.,The Force Awakens
197,Kylo Ren,Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid. Unharmed.,The Force Awakens

237,Rey,That one's garbage! The garbage will do. Gunner position is down there!,The Force Awakens
239,Rey,No! This ship hasn't flown in years.,The Force Awakens
241,Rey,I can do this. I can do this.,The Force Awakens
243,Unkar,Hey! That's mine!,The Force Awakens
245,Rey,What?,The Force Awakens
247,Rey,BB-8 hold on! I'm going low! What are you doing back there? Are you ever gonna fire back?,The Force Awakens

267,Rey,You got him with one blast!,The Force Awakens
269,Rey,It was perfect.,The Force Awakens
271,Rey,You're okay. He's with the Resistance. He's gonna get you home. We both will. I don't know your name.,The Force Awakens
273,Rey,I'm Rey.,The Force Awakens
275,Rey,Help me with this. Quick!,The Force Awakens

279,Kylo Ren,The droid... stole a freighter?,The Force Awakens
281,Officer,Not exactly sir. It had help. We have no confirmation... but we believe FN-2187 may have helped in the escape.,The Force Awakens
283,Kylo Ren,Anything else?,The Force Awakens
285,Officer,The two were accompanied by a girl.,The Force Awakens
287,Kylo Ren,What girl?,The Force Awakens

291,Rey,If we wanna live not good.,The Force Awakens
293,Rey,"BB-8 said the location of the Resistance base... is ""need to know"". If I'm taking you there I need to know!",The Force Awakens
295,Rey,Pilex driver hurry. So where's your base?,The Force Awakens

303,Rey,It's not that one. No. No.,The Force Awakens
305,Rey,The one I'm pointing to. No. No. No! If we don't patch it up...  the propulsion tank will overflow... and flood the ship with poisonous gas!,The Force Awakens
307,Rey,Yes.,The Force Awakens
309,Rey,None of your business that's why.,The Force Awakens
311,Rey,No it can't be. Someone's locked on to us. All controls are overridden.  Get off! Get off! See anything?,The Force Awakens
313,Rey,What do we do? There must be something.,The Force Awakens
315,Rey,I fixed that.,The Force Awakens
317,Rey,Come on BB-8.,The Force Awakens
319,Rey,Do you think this will work on the stormtroopers?,The Force Awakens
321,Han Solo,Chewie... we're home. Where are the others? Where's the pilot?,The Force Awakens
323,Rey,I'm the pilot.,The Force Awakens

347,Rey,This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?,The Force Awakens
349,Han Solo,Twelve! Fourteen. Hey! Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line.,The Force Awakens
351,Rey,Unkar Plutt did.  I thought it was a mistake too. Puts too much...,The Force Awakens
353,Rey / Han,...stress on the hyperdrive.,The Force Awakens
355,Han Solo,Chewie throw them in a pod. We'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet.,The Force Awakens
357,Rey,Wait no. We need your help.,The Force Awakens

375,Han Solo,I used to have a bigger crew. Get below and stay there until I say so... and don't even think about taking the Falcon.,The Force Awakens
377,Rey,What about BB-8?,The Force Awakens
379,Han Solo,He stays with me until I get rid of the gang... then you can have him back and be on your way.,The Force Awakens
381,Han Solo,There's one.,The Force Awakens
383,Rey,What are you gonna do?,The Force Awakens
385,Han Solo,Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it. Yes I do. Every time.,The Force Awakens
387,Bala-Tik,Han Solo. You're a dead man.,The Force Awakens
389,Han Solo,Bala-Tik. What's the problem?,The Force Awakens

417,Bala-Tik,Yeah.,The Force Awakens
419,Han Solo,What was the second time?,The Force Awakens
421,Bala-Tik,Your game is old. There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle. That BB unit. The First Order is looking for one just like it. And two fugitives.,The Force Awakens
423,Han Solo,First I've heard of it.,The Force Awakens
425,Rey,Wait wait wait. If we close the blast doors in that corridor... we can trap both gangs!,The Force Awakens
427,Rey,Resetting the fuses should do it.,The Force Awakens
429,Han Solo,I got a bad feeling about this.,The Force Awakens
431,Rey,Oh no.,The Force Awakens
433,Rey,Wrong fuses.,The Force Awakens
435,Bala-Tik,Kill them! And take the droid!,The Force Awakens
437,Rey,Huge! What do they look like?,The Force Awakens

455,Han Solo,You close the door behind us. You take care of Chewie! Hey where are you going?,The Force Awakens
457,Rey,Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump too.  If we don't prime that we're not going anywhere.,The Force Awakens
459,Han Solo,I hate that guy.,The Force Awakens
461,Rey,And you could use a co-pilot.,The Force Awakens
463,Han Solo,I got one he's back there. Watch the thrust. We're going out of here at lightspeed.,The Force Awakens
465,Rey,From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?,The Force Awakens
467,Han Solo,I never ask that question till after I've done it. This is not how I thought this day was gonna go. Angle the shield. Hang on back there.,The Force Awakens
469,Han Solo,Come on baby don't let me down. What?,The Force Awakens
471,Rey,Compressor.,The Force Awakens
473,Bala-Tik,Inform the First Order...  that Han Solo has the droid they want. And it's  aboard the Millennium Falcon.,The Force Awakens
475,Snoke,The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance... leading them to the last Jedi. If Skywalker returns... the new Jedi will rise.,The Force Awakens
477,General Hux,Supreme Leader I take full responsibility...,The Force Awakens
479,Snoke,General! Our strategy must now change.,The Force Awakens
481,General Hux,The weapon. It is ready. I believe the time has come to use it.  We shall destroy the government... that supports the Resistance... the Republic.  Without their friends to protect them... the Resistance will be vulnerable. And we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.,The Force Awakens
483,Snoke,Go. Oversee preparations.,The Force Awakens
485,General Hux,Yes Supreme Leader.,The Force Awakens
487,Snoke,There has been an awakening. Have you felt it?,The Force Awakens
489,Kylo Ren,Yes.,The Force Awakens
491,Snoke,There's something more. The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon. In the hands of your father... Han Solo.,The Force Awakens
493,Kylo Ren,He means nothing to me.,The Force Awakens
495,Snoke,Even you master of the Knights of Ren... have never faced such a test.,The Force Awakens
497,Kylo Ren,By the grace of your training I will not be seduced.,The Force Awakens
499,Snoke,We shall see. We shall see.,The Force Awakens
501,Han Solo,Electrical overload.,The Force Awakens
503,Rey,I can fix that.,The Force Awakens
505,Han Solo,Coolant's leaking.,The Force Awakens
507,Rey,Try transferring auxiliary power...,The Force Awakens
509,Rey / Han,...to the secondary tank.,The Force Awakens
511,Han Solo,I got it.,The Force Awakens
513,Han Solo,You hurt Chewie you're gonna deal with me! ,The Force Awakens
515,Han Solo,This hyperdrive blows there are gonna be pieces of us in three different systems. What'd you do?,The Force Awakens
517,Rey,I bypassed the compressor.,The Force Awakens
519,Han Solo,Huh. Move ball. Ah don't say that. You did great. Just rest. Good job kid. Thanks.,The Force Awakens
521,Han Solo,So... fugitives huh?,The Force Awakens
523,Rey,The First Order wants the map. Finn is with the Resistance. I'm just a scavenger.,The Force Awakens
525,Han Solo,Let's see what you got.,The Force Awakens
527,Rey,Go ahead.,The Force Awakens
529,Han Solo,This map's not complete. It's just a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared  people have been looking for him.,The Force Awakens
531,Rey,Why did he leave?,The Force Awakens
533,Han Solo,He was training a new generation of Jedi.  One boy an apprentice... turned against him destroyed it all. Luke felt responsible. He just walked away from everything.,The Force Awakens
535,Han Solo,A lot of rumors. Stories. People that knew him best... think he went looking for the first Jedi temple. Think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.,The Force Awakens
537,Rey,The Jedi were real?,The Force Awakens
539,Han Solo,I used to wonder about that myself. Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. A magical power holding together good and evil... the dark side and the light. Crazy thing is... it's true. The Force. The Jedi. All Of it. It's all true. No you rest. You want my help? You're getting it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home. This is our stop.,The Force Awakens
541,Rey,I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy.,The Force Awakens
543,Han Solo,Did you just call me Solo?,The Force Awakens
545,Han Solo,Listen Big Deal. You got another problem. Women always figure out the truth. Always. You might need this.,The Force Awakens
547,Rey,I think I can handle myself.,The Force Awakens
549,Han Solo,I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you. Take it. You know how to use one of those?,The Force Awakens
551,Rey,Yeah. You pull the trigger.,The Force Awakens
553,Han Solo,Little bit more to it than that. You got a lot to learn. You got a name?,The Force Awakens
555,Rey,Rey,The Force Awakens
557,Han Solo,Rey. I been thinking about bringing on some more crew Rey. A second mate. Someone to help out. Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me... appreciates the Falcon.,The Force Awakens
559,Rey,Are you offering me a job?,The Force Awakens
561,Han Solo,I wouldn't be nice to you. Doesn't pay much.,The Force Awakens
563,Rey,You're offering me a job.,The Force Awakens
565,Han Solo,I'm thinking about it. Well?,The Force Awakens
567,Rey,If you were I'd be flattered. But I have to get home.,The Force Awakens
569,Han Solo,Where Jakku?,The Force Awakens
571,Rey,I've already been away too long.,The Force Awakens
573,Han Solo,Chewie check out the ship as best you can. That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.,The Force Awakens
575,Han Solo,To get your droid on a clean ship.,The Force Awakens
577,Rey,Clean?,The Force Awakens
579,Han Solo,You think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon?  If we can find it on our scanners... the First Order's not far behind. Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata's our best bet.,The Force Awakens
581,Han Solo,Relax kid. She's run this watering hole for a thousand years. Maz is a bit of an acquired taste... so let me do the talking. And whatever you do don't stare.,The Force Awakens
583,Rey / Finn,At what?,The Force Awakens
585,Han Solo,Any of it.,The Force Awakens
587,Maz Kanata,Han Solo!,The Force Awakens
589,Han Solo,Oh boy. Hey Maz.,The Force Awakens
591,Maz Kanata,Where's my boyfriend?,The Force Awakens
593,Han Solo,Chewie's working on the Falcon.,The Force Awakens
595,Maz Kanata,I like that Wookiee. I assume you need something. Desperately. Let's get to it.,The Force Awakens
597,Kylo Ren,Forgive me.  I feel it again. The pull to the light. Supreme Leader senses it. Show me again. The power of the darkness. And I will let nothing stand in our way. Show me... Grandfather...  and I Will finish... what you started.,The Force Awakens
599,Maz Kanata,A map. To Skywalker himself? You are right back in the mess.,The Force Awakens
601,Han Solo,Maz I need you to get this droid to Leia. ,The Force Awakens
603,Maz Kanata,Hmm... No. You've been running away from this fight for too long. Han. Go home.,The Force Awakens
605,Han Solo,Leia doesn't wanna see me.,The Force Awakens
607,Rey,What fight?,The Force Awakens
609,Maz Kanata,The only fight. Against the dark side. Through the ages... I've seen evil take many forms. The Sith. The Empire. Today it is the First Order. Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy. We must face them. Fight them. All of us.,The Force Awakens
611,Maz Kanata,If you live long enough...   you see the same eyes in different people. I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.,The Force Awakens
613,Maz Kanata,Hmm. You see those two? They'll trade work for transportation... to the Outer Rim. There you can disappear.,The Force Awakens
615,Rey,Finn?,The Force Awakens
617,Rey,What about BB-8? We're not done yet. We have to get him back to your base.,The Force Awakens
619,Han Solo,Keep it kid.,The Force Awakens
621,Maz Kanata,Who's the girl?,The Force Awakens
623,Rey,What are you doing? ,The Force Awakens
625,Rey,You can't just go. I won't let you.,The Force Awakens
627,Rey,Finn what are you talking about?,The Force Awakens
629,Rey,Don't go.,The Force Awakens
631,Rey,No! ,The Force Awakens
633,Yoda,Its energy...  surrounds us... and binds us...,The Force Awakens
635,Obi Wan,The Force will be...,The Force Awakens
637,Rey,No! Come back!,The Force Awakens
639,Unkar,Quiet girl.,The Force Awakens
641,Obi Wan,Rey? These are your first steps.,The Force Awakens
643,Rey,What was that? I shouldn't have gone in there.,The Force Awakens
645,Maz Kanata,That lightsaber was Luke's. And his father's before him. And now it calls to you.,The Force Awakens
647,Rey,I have to get back to Jakku. ,The Force Awakens
649,Maz Kanata,Han told me. Dear child. I see your eyes. You already know the truth. Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku... they're never coming back. But... there's someone who still could. ,The Force Awakens
651,Rey,Luke. ,The Force Awakens
653,Maz Kanata,The belonging you seek is not behind you... it is ahead. I am no Jedi but I know the Force.  It moves through and surrounds every living thing.  Close your eyes. Feel it. The light... it's always been there. It will guide you. The saber. Take it.,The Force Awakens
655,Rey,I'm never touching that thing again. I don't want any part of this.,The Force Awakens
657,Maz Kanata,Hmm.,The Force Awakens
659,General Hux,Today is the end of the Republic. The end of a regime that acquiesces to disorder. At this very moment in a system far from here... the New Republic lies to the galaxy... while secretly supporting the treachery... of the loathsome Resistance. This fierce machine which you have built upon which we stand will bring an end to the Senate! To their cherished fleet!  All remaining systems will bow to the First Order! And will remember this as the last day of the Republic!,The Force Awakens
661,Officer,Confirm transfer to manual control. Configure!,The Force Awakens
663,General Hux,Fire!,The Force Awakens
665,Citizen,No. What is it? ,The Force Awakens
667,Rey,What are you doing? You have to go back. I'm leaving. BB-8... No you can't. You have to go back you're too important. They'll help you.,The Force Awakens
669,Maz Kanata,I've had this for ages. Kept it locked away.,The Force Awakens
671,Han Solo,Where'd you get that?,The Force Awakens
673,Maz Kanata,A good question. For another time. Take it. Find your friend! Those beasts. They're here.,The Force Awakens
675,Storm Trooper,FN-417 hold position.,The Force Awakens
677,Rey,Oh safety.,The Force Awakens
679,Storm Trooper,Sir. The droid was spotted heading west. With a girl.,The Force Awakens
681,Rey,You have to keep going. Stay out of sight. I'll try to fight them off. I hope so too.,The Force Awakens
683,Han Solo,Come on Chewie!,The Force Awakens
685,Rey,Rey and BB-8! They need you! Now! Go!,The Force Awakens
687,Maz Kanata,You have one!,The Force Awakens
689,Han Solo,Hey can I try that? I like this thing.,The Force Awakens
691,Storm Trooper,Traitor!,The Force Awakens
693,Han Solo,You okay Big Deal?,The Force Awakens
695,Storm Trooper,Don't move- TK-338 we have targets in custody.,The Force Awakens
697,Poe Dameron ,Go straight at them! Don't let these dogs scare you!,The Force Awakens
699,Unknown Lady,Copy that.,The Force Awakens
701,Unknown Man,We're with you Poe.,The Force Awakens
703,Han Solo,Quick!,The Force Awakens
705,Poe Dameron ,Whoo-hoo!,The Force Awakens
707,Kylo Ren,The girl I've heard so much about. The droid. Where is it?,The Force Awakens
709,Storm Trooper,Request air support.,The Force Awakens
711,Kylo Ren,The map. You've seen it.,The Force Awakens
713,Storm Trooper,Sir Resistance fighters. We need more troops.,The Force Awakens
715,Kylo Ren,Pull the division out. Forget the droid. We have what we need.,The Force Awakens
717,Storm Trooper,Pull back to tree line!,The Force Awakens
719,Han Solo,Yeah I know.,The Force Awakens
721,Commander,Let's go! ,The Force Awakens
723,Han Solo,You changed your hair.,The Force Awakens
725,Leia,Same jacket.,The Force Awakens
727,Han Solo,No new jacket. I saw him. Leia I saw our son. He was here.,The Force Awakens
729,Poe Dameron ,BB-8 my buddy. Oh it's so good to see you. Finn saved you? Where is he?,The Force Awakens
731,Poe Dameron ,Oh No.,The Force Awakens
733,Poe Dameron ,Buddy! So are you!,The Force Awakens
735,Poe Dameron ,I got thrown from the crash.  I woke up at night. No you. No ship. Nothing. BB-8 says that you saved him.,The Force Awakens
737,Poe Dameron ,You completed my mission Finn... That's my jacket.,The Force Awakens
739,Poe Dameron ,No no no. Keep it. It suits you. You're a good man Finn.,The Force Awakens
741,nnouncer,PZ-4CO report to communications.,The Force Awakens
743,Poe Dameron ,General Organa... I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn. He needs to talk to you.,The Force Awakens
745,Leia,And I need to talk to him. That was incredibly brave what you did.  Renouncing the First Order saving this man's life.,The Force Awakens
747,Leia,Han told me about the girl. I'm sorry.,The Force Awakens
749,Poe Dameron ,Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system. He worked on the base.,The Force Awakens
751,Leia,We're desperate for anything you can tell us.,The Force Awakens
753,Leia,And I will do everything I can to help... but first you need to tell us all you know.,The Force Awakens
755,oman,That sounds very scary. You must be so brave.,The Force Awakens
757,C-3PO,General... I regret to inform you...but this map recovered from BB-8... is only partially complete. And even worse it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information... to locate Master Luke.,The Force Awakens
759,Leia,Can't believe I was so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home.,The Force Awakens
761,Han Solo,Leia.,The Force Awakens
763,Leia,Don't do that.,The Force Awakens
765,Han Solo,Do what?,The Force Awakens
767,Leia,Anything-,The Force Awakens
769,Han Solo,I'm trying to be helpful.,The Force Awakens
771,Leia,When did that ever help?  And don't say the Death Star.,The Force Awakens
773,C-3PO,BB-8. You're wasting your time. It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data. I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in low-power mode ever since Master Luke went away. Sadly he may never be his old self again.,The Force Awakens
775,Han Solo,Listen to me will you? I know every time you... Every time you look at me you're reminded of him.,The Force Awakens
777,Leia,You think I want to forget him? I want him back.,The Force Awakens
779,Han Solo,There's nothing more we could have done. There's too much Vader in him.,The Force Awakens
781,Leia,That's why I wanted him to train with Luke. I just never should have sent him away. That's when I lost him. That's when I lost you both.,The Force Awakens
783,Han Solo,We both had to deal with it in our own way. I went back to the only thing I was ever any good at. ,The Force Awakens
785,Leia,We both did.,The Force Awakens
787,Han Solo,We lost our son. Forever.,The Force Awakens
789,Leia,No. It was Snoke. He seduced our son to the dark side. But we can still save him. Me. You.,The Force Awakens
791,Han Solo,If Luke couldn't reach him how could I?,The Force Awakens
793,Leia,Luke is a Jedi. You're his father. There is still light in him I know it.,The Force Awakens
795,Officer,General the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.,The Force Awakens
797,Rey,Where am I?,The Force Awakens
799,Kylo Ren,You're my guest.,The Force Awakens
801,Rey,Where are the others?,The Force Awakens
803,Kylo Ren,Do you mean the murderers... traitors and thieves you call friends? You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea. You still want to kill me.,The Force Awakens
805,Rey,That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.,The Force Awakens
807,Kylo Ren,Tell me about the droid.,The Force Awakens
809,Rey,He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.,The Force Awakens
811,Kylo Ren,It's carrying a section of a navigational chart. And we have the rest. Recovered from the archives of the Empire but we need the last piece. And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you. You. A scavenger. You know I can take whatever I want. You're so lonely. So afraid to leave. At night desperate to sleep. You imagine an ocean. I see it. I see the island. And Han Solo. You feel like he's the father you never had. He would have disappointed you.,The Force Awakens
813,Rey,Get out of my head.,The Force Awakens
815,Kylo Ren,I know you've seen the map. It's in there. And now you'll give it to me. Don't be afraid. I feel it too.,The Force Awakens
817,Rey,I'm not giving you anything.,The Force Awakens
819,Kylo Ren,We'll see. You. You're afraid. That you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.,The Force Awakens
821,Snoke,The scavenger... resisted you?,The Force Awakens
823,Kylo Ren,She is strong with the Force. Untrained but stronger than she knows.,The Force Awakens
825,Snoke,And the droid?,The Force Awakens
827,General Hux,Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us. That the girl was all we needed. As a result the droid has most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy. They may have the map already.,The Force Awakens
829,Snoke,Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.,The Force Awakens
831,General Hux,We have their location. We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the lleenium system.,The Force Awakens
833,Snoke,Good. Then we will crush them once and for all. Prepare the weapon.,The Force Awakens
835,Kylo Ren,Supreme Leader I can get the map from the girl. I just need your guidance.,The Force Awakens
837,Snoke,If what you say about this girl is true... Bring her to me.,The Force Awakens
839,Rey,You will remove these restraints... and leave this cell with the door open.,The Force Awakens
841,Rey,You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.,The Force Awakens
843,Rey,You will remove these restraints... and leave this cell with the door open.,The Force Awakens
845,Rey,And you'll drop your weapon.,The Force Awakens
847,Kylo Ren,No. No. Guards! Guards!,The Force Awakens
849,General Hux,Begin charging the weapon.,The Force Awakens
851,Officer,Yes sir. Weapon charging.,The Force Awakens
853,Poe Dameron ,The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.,The Force Awakens
855,Officer,They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.,The Force Awakens
857,Officer,We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.,The Force Awakens
859,Emmat,It's another Death Star.,The Force Awakens
861,Poe Dameron ,I wish that were the case Major. This was the Death Star. And this is Starkiller Base.,The Force Awakens
863,Han Solo,So it's big.,The Force Awakens
865,Unknown Creature,How is it possible to power a weapon of that size?,The Force Awakens
867,Officer,Ma'am.,The Force Awakens
869,Leia,The First Order they're charging the weapon again now. Our system is the next target.,The Force Awakens
871,Han Solo,Okay. How do we blow it up? There's always a way to do that.,The Force Awakens
873,Leia,Han's right.,The Force Awakens
875,Statura,In order for that amount of power to be contained... that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator.,The Force Awakens
877,Statura,If we can destroy that oscillator... it might destabilize the core and cripple the weapon. ,The Force Awakens
879,Officer,Maybe the planet.,The Force Awakens
881,Poe Dameron ,We'll go in there we'll hit that oscillator with everything we've got.,The Force Awakens
883,nknown Creature,They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.,The Force Awakens
885,Han Solo,We disable the shields. Kid you worked there. What do you got?,The Force Awakens
887,Han Solo,I like this guy.,The Force Awakens
889,Han Solo,We'll get you there.,The Force Awakens
891,Leia,Han how?,The Force Awakens
893,Han Solo,If I told you you wouldn't like it.,The Force Awakens
895,Poe Dameron ,So we disable the shields we take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun. All right. Let's go.,The Force Awakens
897,Han Solo,Chewie check that donal capitator. Come on. Let's go. Finn be careful with those. They're explosives.,The Force Awakens
899,Leia,You know no matter how much we fought I've always hated watching you leave.,The Force Awakens
901,Han Solo,That's why I did it.  So you'd miss me.,The Force Awakens
903,Leia,I did miss you.,The Force Awakens
905,Han Solo,It wasn't all bad was it? Huh? Some of it was... good.,The Force Awakens
907,Leia,Pretty good.,The Force Awakens
909,Han Solo,Some things never change.,The Force Awakens
911,Leia,True. You still drive me crazy. If you see our son... bring him home.,The Force Awakens
913,Kylo Ren,She's just beginning to test her powers. The longer it takes to find her... the more dangerous she becomes.,The Force Awakens
915,nnouncer,All sentry droids... all sentry droids... resynchronize to Galactic Standard Time. Offset 473.,The Force Awakens
917,Han Solo,Their shields have a fractional refresh rate. Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.,The Force Awakens
919,Han Solo,Chewie get ready. And... Now! I am pulling up! I get any higher... they'll see us!,The Force Awakens
921,Officer,Sir she was not found in Hangar 718. But all troops are on alert.,The Force Awakens
923,Kylo Ren,Put every hangar on lockdown. She's going to try to steal a ship to esc... Han Solo.,The Force Awakens
925,Han Solo,What was your job when you were based here?,The Force Awakens
927,Han Solo,Sanitation? Then how do you know how to disable the shields?,The Force Awakens
929,Han Solo,People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.,The Force Awakens
931,Han Solo,That's not how the Force works. Oh really? You're cold?,The Force Awakens
933,General Hux,Report.,The Force Awakens
935,Officer,Weapon charged in 15 minutes sir.,The Force Awakens
937,Han Solo,The longer we're here the less luck we're gonna have. The shields.,The Force Awakens
939,Phasma,FN-2187.,The Force Awakens
941,Han Solo,Bring it down. Bring it down.,The Force Awakens
943,Phasma,You're making a big mistake.,The Force Awakens
945,Han Solo,Don't worry kid. We won't leave here without her.,The Force Awakens
947,Phasma,You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy. My troops will storm this block and kill you all.,The Force Awakens
949,Han Solo,I disagree. ,The Force Awakens
951,Han Solo,Is there a garbage chute? Trash compactor?,The Force Awakens
953,Officer,General their shields are down.,The Force Awakens
955,C-3PO,Thank the Maker!,The Force Awakens
957,Leia,Han did it. Send them in.,The Force Awakens
959,Statura,Give Poe full authorization for attack.,The Force Awakens
961,Poe Dameron ,Roger base. Red squad Blue squad take my lead. Dropping out of lightspeed. Almost in range. Hit the target dead center. As many runs as we can get.,The Force Awakens
963,Pilot,Approaching target.,The Force Awakens
965,Officer,Fighters incoming!,The Force Awakens
967,General Hux,Dispatch all squadrons.,The Force Awakens
969,Captain,Yes General.,The Force Awakens
971,Poe Dameron ,All right. Let's light it up.,The Force Awakens
973,Poe Dameron ,Yeah we gotta keep hitting it. Another bombing run. Remember when the sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire. But as long as there's light we got a chance. Guys we got a lot of company!,The Force Awakens
975,Han Solo,You sure you're up for this?,The Force Awakens
977,Han Solo,You all right?,The Force Awakens
979,Rey,Yeah.,The Force Awakens
981,Han Solo,Good.,The Force Awakens
983,Rey,Finn what are you doing here?,The Force Awakens
985,Rey,That it was your idea. Thank you.,The Force Awakens
987,Rey,I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.,The Force Awakens
989,Han Solo,Escape now hug later. ,The Force Awakens

1009,Kylo Ren,Han Solo. I've been waiting for this day for a long time.,The Force Awakens
1011,Han Solo,Take off that mask. You don't need it.,The Force Awakens
1013,Kylo Ren,What do you think you'll see if I do?,The Force Awakens
1015,Han Solo,The face of my son.,The Force Awakens
1017,Kylo Ren,Your son is gone. He was weak and foolish like his father. ,The Force Awakens
1019,Han Solo,That's what Snoke wants you to believe. But it's not true. My son is alive.,The Force Awakens
1021,Kylo Ren,No. The Supreme Leader is wise.,The Force Awakens
1023,Han Solo,Snoke is using you for your power. When he gets what he wants he'll crush you. You know it's true.,The Force Awakens
1025,Kylo Ren,It's too late. ,The Force Awakens
