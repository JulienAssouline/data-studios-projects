  <h1> Video Games Make Terrible Movies </h1>
  <div align="center" style="width:600px; margin:0 auto; font-size:17px; font-family: Bree serif;">

  <p> <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/805954/The-Witcher-Netflix-release-date-latest-news-Geralt-Rivia-Andrzej-Sapkowski-trailer-cast"> Netflix announced </a> that they were going to produce a TV series based on The Witcher. The books, not the game. This bodes well for Netflix, because there haven’t been many successful movies based off of video games. 
 <p>

 <p>One of the latest attempts was turning the Assassin’s Creed video game series into a movie. They even got renowned actors such as Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard to star in the movie, and yet it was still a flub. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/"> Rotten Tomatoes</a> gave it a rating of 18%.<p>

 <p>Assassin's Creed though wasn’t an aberration. It wasn’t just one bad movie out of a batch of good ones. On average Assassins Creed 18% rating was basically the average rating for movies based on video games which stands at 17.9%. <p>

  <h2> Rotten Tomatoes ratings on movies based from video games </h2>

  <div align="left" style="width:600px; margin:0 auto; font-size:17px; font-family: Bree serif;">
  <p> Rotten Tomatoes gives a rating out of 100. Movies with under a rating of 60% are considered “Rotten”. Movies with a rating of 60% or better are considered “Fresh” and movie with a rating of 75 or better are considered “Certified Fresh”. 
 <p>

<p>No movie based on a video game has ever been considered “Fresh” by Rotten Tomatoes. In fact the best rating ever given to a movie based on a video game was “Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within”. <p>

<p>The move, therefore, by Netflix to base the movie on the books rather than the video games seems to be a good one and next time you get excited about a movie, based on a video game, it might be best to step back and lower your expectations, because there’s never been a quality movie of that type.<p>
