  <br>There were approximately 17 million refugees in 2016, the highest number ever recorded by the United Nations.<br>

  <br>Refugees come from everywhere around the world. It's an issue that is pertinent on every continent, and to a certain extent, every country. <br>

  <br>Most refugees, though, come from Syria.<br>

  <br>More than 5 million, which is the largest number of refugees from any country around the world. It has more than double the number of refugees from Afganistan, which has the second most refugees, with just over 2.5 million. <br>

<br>Syrian refugees don't go very far when they escape. Their main destinations are Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Germany, Iraq, and Egypt. <br>

  <div align="left" style="width:600px; margin:0 auto; font-size:17px">

<br>Just under 3 million of all Syrian refugees escaped to Turkey, which took in more Syrian refugees than any other country in 2016. <br>

<br>Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Egypt took in 87 percent of all Syrian refugees in 2016. Issues of Syrian refugees are often discussed in countries such as the United States, and how allowing them in will affect their country, but most Syrian refugees don't choose to move to the United States or Canada. Most chose to escape to their neighboring countries.<br>

  <div align="left" style="width:600px; margin:0 auto; font-size:17px">

<br>The Syrian refugee crisis though wasn't always this bad. In 2011 there were "only" around 20 thousand Syrian refugees. From 2011 to 2016, there has been a 27,617% increase in Syrian refugees. It's the most precipitous rise in refugees since the United Nations started recording refugee data. <br>

<br>This isn't the largest refugee crisis in from one country in recorded history. At least, not by the numbers. The largest crisis came in the late 80s and early 90s from Afghanistan. In 1990 there were more than 6 million refugees from Afghanistan, the largest number of refugees from any single country. <br>
